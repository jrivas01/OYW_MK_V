<br>The maps are divided into three types of area: Territories, Locations, and Compounds. Locations exist inside Territories, and Compounds can exist inside Locations or Territories. You may only move between adjacent areas, and each move is one move action. For example, Side 5 is a Location inside the Territory 2 Days from Earth (2E), and Texas Colony is a Compound in Side 5. It is one move action to go from 2E to Side 5, and another to go from Side 5 to Texas Colony. The reverse is also true.
<br>
<br>Base pages can be found by clicking on the individual flags on the map. Installations are the larger flags, while Facilities are the smaller flags. Individual base pages alternate between present defenses and descriptions/map via links on the names.

<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b>Asteroid Belt</b></font></center>
<br>The Asteroid Belt only consists of three locations, depicted on a line running Nearside, Center, Farside. The Asteroid Belt doesn't have any Territories.
<br>
<br>The following are additional rules and restrictions that apply to movement in the Asteroid Belt.
<br>
<br><b>Purchases</b>
<br>You may not make any purchases other than Compounds, their accessories, and Variants in the Asteroid Belt. Rogue members may additionally purchase Services, Cargo, and Infantry. Zeon members and Rogue members allied with Zeon may make purchases as normal on AXIS.
<br>
<br><b>Weather</b>
<br>While the center of the Asteroid Belt is generally devoid of activity, sometimes a thick cluster of large asteroids wanders past your location. Weather for the Center of the belt will be determined once a week. Just because one location is experiencing bad conditions doesn't mean you will be caught in it, but it's better to be prepared than try your luck.
<br>
<br><b>Deep Space</b>
<br>It is possible to travel to the Mars Sphere or Earth Sphere from Nearside, and the Jupiter Sphere from Farside. This is not something you're expected to do regularly, and rules for this are listed on the <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1587&page=1#16663" target=new><u>message board.</u></a>
<br>
<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b>Location Descriptions</b></font></center>
<br>
<br><b>Center</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The middle of the Asteroid Belt is somewhat thicker of debris than either Farside or Nearside. A dangerous area for travel, ships maintain alerts and watch for large rocks that must be evaded or destroyed. The largest asteroids are home to highly profitable mining settlements, with some 30 million people living in this region. Combat in this territory is very similar to one of the Earth Sphere's shoal zones, with a somewhat lower amount of total debris most of the time.
<br>
<br><b>Farside</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The outer end of the Asteroid Belt, this area is approximately as thin of debris as Nearside. Ship travel here  is not especially dangerous, but the amount of stellar dust forces interplanetary spacecraft to slow down and retract solar sails. Combat in this territory is generally not much different than that in the Earth Sphere, only a small number of asteroids roaming about.
<br>
<br><b>Nearside</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The inner end of the Asteroid Belt, this area is approximately as thin of debris as Farside. Ship travel here  is not especially dangerous, but the amount of stellar dust forces interplanetary spacecraft to slow down and retract solar sails. Combat in this territory is generally not much different than that in the Earth Sphere, only a small number of asteroids roaming about.
