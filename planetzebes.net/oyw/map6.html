<br>The maps are divided into three types of area: Territories, Locations, and Compounds. Locations exist inside Territories, and Compounds can exist inside Locations or Territories. You may only move between adjacent areas, and each move is one move action. For example, Side 5 is a Location inside the Territory 2 Days from Earth (2E), and Texas Colony is a Compound in Side 5. It is one move action to go from 2E to Side 5, and another to go from Side 5 to Texas Colony. The reverse is also true.
<br>
<br>Base pages can be found by clicking on the individual flags on the map. Installations are the larger flags, while Facilities are the smaller flags. Individual base pages alternate between present defenses and descriptions/map via links on the names.
<br>
<br>
<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b>Mars Surface</b></font></center>
<br>The entire planet Mars exists inside the 0 days from Mars territory, with the sectors on the map above classed as Locations. Each Mars Location and all Compounds on Mars are adjacent to the Mars Orbit Location, which must be moved through when going between Mars surface and 0 Days from Mars. Note that the hemispheres are not adjacent at the diagonals.
<br>
<br>The following additional rules and restrictions apply to movement on Mars.
<br>
<br><b>Mars Orbit</b>
<br>Players must be on a Compound equipped with a Spaceport to move from Mars to Mars Orbit, or moving to a Compound equipped with a Spaceport on the planet. Space class ships can move to and from Spaceport equipped compounds, but they may not move to any other Mars locations.
<br>
<br><b>(O)</b> class ships and mobile suits can move from Mars Orbit to any Location or Compound on Mars. They must use spaceports to return to Mars Orbit.
<br>
<br>Ships with M Craft systems can move to Mars Orbit from any Location or Compound on Mars freely.
<br>
<br><b>Purchases</b>
<br>You may not make any purchases other than Compounds, their accessories, and Variants on Mars' Surface. Rogue members may additionally purchase Services, Cargo and Infantry.
<br>
<br><b>Weather</b>
<br>Locations on Mars are sometimes plagued with bad weather, which hinders combat of any variety. Weather for each location will be determined once a week. Just because one location is experiencing bad conditions doesn't mean you will be caught in it, but it's better to be prepared than try your luck.
<br>
<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b>Area Descriptions</b></font></center>
<br>
<br><b>Mars Orbit</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> Just outside Mars atmosphere, this area is similar to Earths atmosphere, although due to a weaker gravitational pull is not quite so dangerous. Beware of combat here; smaller craft, chiefly fighters and mobile suits, run the risk of being caught by gravity and falling to their doom. 
<br>
<br><b>Northeastern Hemisphere</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> In the beginning fo the Universal Century, the CMC looked to Mars for a source of space colony building materials, and built many settlements to use for mining on the planets surface. When the expense of sending goods to orbits and the bad weather conditions on the planet were realized, more than half of the settlers were moved to the Asteroid Belt, which quickly outdid Mars in the mineral industry. However, a few settlements and some hardy people still remain. Space suits are not needed on Mars' surface, but travel without an oxygen mask and a winter coat is impossible.
<br>
<br><b>Northwestern Hemisphere</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> This part of Mars is characterized by the tremendous mountain of Olympus Mons, as well as the CMC capital of the planet at Amador City. Amador is inside the mountain, and home to 2 million of the Mars Spheres 10 million citizens. Any trade or shuttles that still travel to Mars from the rest of the Solar System do so through Amador. Much like the rest of the planet, a few small settlements and a number of old mines dot the surface of the hemisphere, with the northern end a frozen wasteland.
<br>
<br><b>Southeastern Hemisphere</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> This area of the Martian surface is the second most populated, the large Hellas Impact Basin home to several small settlements. Much as with the rest of the surface, the settlements are partially underground, with small highways leading to mines that surround the settlements themselves. The people in this area are a long way from Amador, and by 0079 have more or less started governing themselves.
<br>

<br><b>Southwestern Hemisphere</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The least populated area of Mars, the terrain in the Southwestern Hemisphere is not as viable for mining, and there are few settlements. This area is also home to the gigantic Valles Marinaris, a huge gorge that cuts through a massive portion of the Martian surface.
