The Federation was well behind the curve of mobile suit design when the One Year War began in January. However, after months of research at break-neck speeds, they are beginning to catch up with fruitful results. Taking data gathered from the RX-78 Gundam and the pre-production RGM-79E and RGM-79[G] high-performance models, the simplified, standardized GM was created. Resembling a spartan Gundam, the GM is slowly overtaking the Type 61 and FFS-3 Saberfish as the Federation's general purpose cavalry. Though it is not nearly as powerful as these high-performance variants, it is cheaper to produce and has more redundant systems to prevent the mechanical breakdowns that plagued earlier models.
<p>
The GM's titanium skin is thinner and lighter than the steel of Zeon mobile suits, and while it is somewhat more vulnerable to typical ballistic weaponry, it allows the GM a much lighter weight and a quicker response time. It is also slightly more resistant to beam weapons fire as a result of its higher melting point.
<p>
The GM's reactor does not have a high enough output to power a full-sized beam rifle, so it is equipped with a stock of conventional ballistics. A compact 90mm machinegun forms its standard armament, which is rounded out by a large bazooka. A beam saber is provided for close-range combat. To compensate for the GM's weaker armor, it is also equipped with a large shield to give it greater protection against sustained fire.

<b>90mm machinegun</b> - Standard issue weapon for GM-type mobile suits. It is more compact and easier to manage than the Zaku's 120mm, but it lacks a substantial ammunition supply.
<p>
<center><img src="rgm-79-beamspraygun.jpg"></center>
<b>Beam spray gun</b> - The EFFs mass produced beam weapon. Its short barrel and unsophisticated systems give it a short effective range compared to conventional armament, but it fires mega particles in a slight cone shape, giving it excellent accuracy; it is more of a shotgun than a rifle.
<p>
<center><img src="rgm-79-beamsaber.jpg"></center>
<b>Beam saber</b> - The same sword-type weapon used by nearly all Federation mobile suits. The GM is equipped with one to cut costs and increase production time. 
<p>
<center><img src="rgm-79-shield.JPG"></center>
<b>Shield</b> - The GM's thinner armor is compensated by this large shield, which provides it excellent coverage and protection from enemy ballistics.
