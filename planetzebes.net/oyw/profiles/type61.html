The Earth Federation's standard main battle tank has evolved slightly in the century and a half since the basic design of an AFV was standardized. The Type 61 is a relatively bread-and-butter tank, its only noticeable improvement over twentieth-century designs are its dual main cannons and improved fuel efficiency.
<p>
Though it packs a substantial punch, a tank is still merely a tank (unless it's the monstrous Admiral A-1) when compared to mobile suits. Though Type 61s have scored some kills against Zeon mobile suits during the Earth Invasion, it's still predominantly a mobile suit war. And as the Type 61 has no real gimmick like the Zeon's Magella Attack Tank and its flying turret, it has been relegated primarily to a fire support role.
