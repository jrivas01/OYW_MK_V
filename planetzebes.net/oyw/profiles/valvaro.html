The MA-05 Bigro proved its worth as a very powerful anti-warship mobile armor with great efficiency. However, its abilities against smaller targets, such as enemy mobile suits, were rather substandard. To combat this deficiency, a new complementary mobile armor was developed specifically to destroy mobile suits.
<p>
The MA-06 Val Varo proved to be this mobile armor. Based off of the Bigro's design, the Val Varo placed more emphasis on maneuverability and speed than on heavy firepower. Its body was longer but less tall than the Bigro's, giving it a smaller target silhouette from head-on. Again, two large claws were maintained to assist with the Active Mass-and-Balance Auto-Control (AMBAC) system to provide superior mobility.
<p>
A large mega particle cannon is mounted under the Val Varo's nose; similar in configuration, it sports a higher rate of fire than the Bigro's main gun, though it sacrifices some of its damage output. A pair of large bore missile launchers are positioned at the rear of the Val Varo's stubby wings, and quadruple vulcan guns are mounted further back on the underside of the main body. In addition to a pair of concealed anti-aircraft mega particle guns, the Val Varo also equips a modified version of the MAX-03 Adzam's leader weapons. Rather than wires, the Val Varo's version uses a plasma array to deliver a blistering electrical charge against multiple targets, making it a highly effective unit to deal with massed enemy attacks.
<p>
Additionally, its thick, sloping armor renders it nearly impervious to small arms fire from all but the closest range. Alltogether, it is an ideal mobile armor for fighting mobile suits; however, warships are still best left to its older brother, the Bigro.

<b>Mega Particle Cannon</b> - Though not as powerful as the Bigro's, it sports a higher rate of fire and lower charge time. Also like the Bigro, it is stored in a concealed firing port when not in use.
<p>
<center><img src="ma-06-claws.jpg"></center>
<b>Claws</b> - Like the Bigro, they are intended to be used for AMBAC to increase maneuverability in zero gravity. They are also effective tools for dealing with enemy mobile suits at close range. Similiar to the Hygogg, they can be retracted and folded back against the main body for high-speed cruising; in this configuration, the Val Varo handles like a giant fighter.
<p>

<b>Anti MS beam gun</b> - Highly maneuverable, these short range beam guns need sophisticated targetting equipment to be effectively used by the pilot, and fold under the armor plating when not in use.
<p>

<b>Plasma Leader</b> - A variation of the Adzams leader weapon for space combat. Much like its predecessor, the Plasma Leader can quickly disable enemy units.
