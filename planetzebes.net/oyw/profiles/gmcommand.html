<td colspan="2"><p>While the Earth Federation's deployment of the original series of RGM-79 GMs and related variants proved a major upset to the Zeon Duchy's dominance of mobile suit warfare, Zeon was not far behind in producing a bevy of new and frightening mobile weapons to close the gap. Chiefly in response to the highly successful MS-09 Dom series and under considerable concern for future Zeon designs, the Federation embarked on additional rounds of mobile suit development based on the basic GM design. The result in the general purpose role was the GM Command, a multi-environment mobile suit sporting a significant increase in combat capability over the first generation RGM-79 series. <br>
  <br>
    The GM Command follows the usual structuring of Federal mobile
    suits, but takes them a step further with some enhancements all across
    the board. Firstly, the original two beam sabers were brought back on
    this GM design; the recharge racks were moved to the rear skirt armor to facilitate modular backpacks (see below). A 90mm machine gun and
    a new late-type shield have been provided as stock for most GM types. The GM Command is provided with a lightweight beam rifle, a significant upgrade over the earlier beam spray gun. Though it lacks some of the power of a regular beam rifle, the GM Command's sports a higher charge capacity and handier form factor. The design is furthermore more suitable for mass production, a quality which in and of itself is considered remarkable where the penny-pinching Earth Federal Forces are concerned. </p>
  <p>The GM Command is capable of acting on both space and
terrestrial theatres via an inventive modular backpack system and easily swappable internal components. Indeed, much of its improved performance over the original GM is owed to the optimization for individual combat theatres in zero-gravity and atmospheric conditions; by removing unnecessary components in a given environment, the performance of the mobile suit can be increased well above that of a single-configuration model. </p>
  <p>In spite of numerous production-friendly modifications, the GM Command is still plagued by a significantly higher unit cost than the basic GM models, though it is
expected to be manufactured in greater numbers than the pre-production
RGM-79[G] GM Ground Type - this can chiefly be attributed to forgoing expensive lunar titanium armoring and the more developed state of the Earth Federation's mobile suit production capabilities. <br>

</center>
<b>90mm Machine Gun</b> - A standard ballistic armament of most GM-series mobile suits. Lightweight and compact, a rear-loading magazine (&quot;bullpup&quot; configuration) provides for surprising accuracy. Its magazine capacity is rather limited, however. <br>
<br>
<center><img src="rgm79gbr.png" width="304" height="148">
</center>
<b>Beam Rifle </b> - Somewhat weaker than the RX-78 Gundam's, a large conical E-Cap and improved cooling systems provide for a larger capacity and better rate of fire. With its small size, it is also quite handy and can be easily operated with one hand.<br>
<br>
<center><img src="rgm79gbs.png" width="105" height="215">
</center>
<b>Beam Saber</b> - The same sword-type weapon used by nearly all Federation mobile suits. The GM Command places the beam sabers in a more accessible location on the rear skirt armor.<br>
<br>
<center><img src="rgm78gsb.png" width="118" height="172">
</center>
<b>Space Type </b> - Replacing the GM Command's backpack and some internal systemry allows the GM Command to be fully optimized for zero-gravity combat, ensuring maximum operational capability with a minimum of redundant components.<br>
<br>
<center><img src="rgm-79g-shield.jpg" width="40%">
</center>
<b>Shield</b> - The GM's thinner armor is compensated by a large
shield, which provides it excellent coverage and protection from enemy
ballistics. This late-type shield is a more efficient shape and more economical to produce, while still storing extra magazines. </td>
