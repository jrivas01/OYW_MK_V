A limited production variant of the highly-successful Zugock, MIP continued refining their MSM-07, finally deriving the Z'gok-E, based on a need for a high-performance, high-efficiency mobile suit for commando attacks against heavily fortified positions.
<p>
The Z'gok-E incorporates an entirely new frame, reactor, control system, and is almost a new mobile suit in its own regard. Even more thrusters have been added to increase its land mobility and underwater speed; its 118 knot crusing speed has yet to be trumped, and it will likely continue to hold that record into the future. For missions where maximum speed on land would be required, an ejectable, single-use booster pack can be equipped, offering the Z'gok-E a ridiculous degree of mobility for a brief period of time.
<p>
The Z'gok-E maintains the original Z'gok's armament, but takes everything to a higher level of efficiency. Its mega particle cannons have been modified with a large reserve battery, allowing excess power to build up inside the cannon. This allows the M-particle energy to be rapidly discharged in a machinegun-like burst, or as a single massive shot. The head-mounted missile launchers have been replaced with torpedoes for increased firepower against other marine targets, and an additional claw on each arm has been added as a sort of thumb, giving the Z'gok-E limited manipulator capability.
<p>
Another improvement over the original desgin comes from the construction of its limbs. The Z'gok-E (much like its Hygogg cousin) can retract its arms and legs in closer to its main body, giving it a smaller surface area and improving fuel efficiency while cruising to a level even higher than the Acguy's. Thicker armor plating around the torso gives it a combat survivability even higher than the Gogg's, and numerous redundant systems allow the Z'gok-E to continue functioning even with heavy damage that would shut down lesser mobile suits. High cost and the Zeon's dwindling resources are its only drawbacks.

<b>Rocket Booster</b> - Designed to get the Z'Gok behind enemy lines quickly during an amphibious assault, during this boosters single 30 second burn, the Z'Gok is able to jump better than the RX-78-2 Gundam. When its fuel cell is depleted, the booster automatically jetissons.

<b>Freeze Yard</b> - Zeon MSMs can arm specialized torpedos that fire a substance oddly named "Freeze Yard". This sticky gelatin makes them essentially immune to conventional minefields. However, the substance itself is extremely expensive, and is only issued for important missions.
