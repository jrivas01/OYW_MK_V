The latest war-time Zeon mobile suit series, the Gelgoog is a beast of a machine. It is the first mass-production mobile suit equipped with a beam rifle as a standard armament, as well as the first universal hand-plug system.
<p>
The Gelgoog is the Zeon's firm and deadly response to mass-produced RGM-79 GMs employed by the Federation. It is extremely fast and maneuverable, and arms a number of powerful weapons. Due to its ingenious universal hand plug, it can use virtually any Zeon or Federal weapon. Its standard armament includes a powerful and highly accurate beam rifle, more or less the same as the RX-78 Gundam's, a beam saber, and a large shield, capable of covering its entire body. Two verniers equipped in the Gelgoogs forearms can be removed for heavy 110mm machineguns for ground combat.
<p>
The Gelgoog is extremely mobile, powered by nine (seventeen in the case of the High Mobility Variant) large thrusters. Numerous apogee motors and other jets stipple its body, giving it unprecedented maneuvering ability. It is also decently well armored, though still not quite as tough as the Lunar-titanium equipped Gundam.
<p>
The Gelgoog is also very customizeable, being able to quickly switch between a standard armament, a fuel-guzzling high mobility variant, or an anti-battleship cannon variant. A removable backpack is the only exchanged feature.
<p>
The Gelgoog's main weakness is not a design flaw, but rather its extremely high operating cost. Gelgoogs are high maintainence machines that use large amounts of fuel extremely quickly, and it remains unclear whether or not the Zeon will be able to continue their usage with their dwindling resources.

<b>Beam rifle</b> - Highly accurate and powerful, usually with enough power for around 20 shots.

<b>Shield</b> - This is large enough to cover the Gelgoog's entire body, and is usually stored on the back when not in use.

<b>Beam Saber</b> - This saber is just as powerful as any EF model beam saber.

<b>Gelgoog Variants</b> - The two backpack changes for the Gelgoog are both serious upgrades. While hard on fuel, the Gelgoog HMT is as maneuverable, if not moreso, than a Rick Dom II, and mounts external fuel canisters for extended field actions. The Gelgoog cannons anti-battleship beam cannon can only fire once every 50 seconds, but is as powerful as a Musai's deck gun.
