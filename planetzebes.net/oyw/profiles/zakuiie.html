The Zeon Duchy is known for its flare for inventive mobile suit variants, and this strange Zaku is no exception. The MS-09 Dom's inevitable release would essentially begin replacing the Zaku II as a frontline combat mobile suit, so Zeon engineers felt more than encouraged to develop specialized mobile suits for specific mission roles.
<p>
The MS-06E Reconnaissance Zaku is one such example. The Recon Zaku has been stripped of some of its armor as well as its weapon systems and is bolstered by dozens of additional thrusters and apogee motors, giving it supreme mobility and speed. Ejectable external propellant tanks on its backpack give it a long sortie time, allowing it to keep tabs on enemy forces from long distance for extended periods of time. Dozens of high-speed cameras are mounted all over its body, giving it the ability to take moving video in high detail from all sides simultaneously, regardless of the mobile suit's orientation. It also carries a high-resolution still camera like a handheld weapon. The camera takes extremely detailed photographs of the target as opposed to a video, and massive zoom and focus lenses allow the Recon Zaku to peek in at distant targets. A variable infrared system also allows it to capture images of targets attempting to hide from normal scanning behind obstacles.
<p>
The Zaku Reconnaissance Type is intended exclusively for use in space, as its highly advanced systems and delicate cameras are weak to impact and easily damaged by excessive force.

<b>Recon type Shield</b> - Shield. The Zaku Reconnaissance Type's shield mounts over its arm, providing it some much needed coverage from enemy fire. The Zaku Reconnaissance Type's delicate systems are vulnerable to vibration, so the shield's joint is also equipped with a highly reactive set of shock absorbers to mimimize impact force.
<p>
<center><img src="ms-06e-cameragun.jpg"></center>
<b>Camera Gun</b> - Camera. The Zaku Reconnaissance Type's handheld camera is a highly precise piece of hardware intended to provide extremely high quality still images at great range. The cameras mounted on the Zaku's main body provide constant video feed from all angles; the handheld camera is designed to provide a stable photograph in both the normal and infrared spectrum, depending on the mission necessity.
