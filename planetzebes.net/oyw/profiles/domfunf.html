Based off reports of strong successes from their MS-09R Rick Doms in the field, Zimmad Corporation continued the further refinement of their Dom series with two new mobile suits: the MS-09R2 Rick Dom II, a heavy assault mobile suit intended exclusively for space combat, and the MS-09F Dom Funf, a universal mobile suit for both space and land combat.
<p>
The Dom Funf carries with it a number of noticible differences over older Dom designs. Blocky shoulder and knee armor give it a very heavy appearance, as well as large joint armor. Unlike the Rick Dom II, the Dom Funf is essentially an upgraded Dom: equally at home in either space or land, though it still requires the obvious change of engine components to switch between the two.
<p>
The Dom Funf's primary armament is the new Mk II Giant Bazooka, designed for taking out tough Federal mobile suits, and even sporting a good track record against Luna Titanium armor. The Funf retains the Zaku Kai's MMP-80 and heat saber as backup weaponry, and is much more often equipped with Panzer Fausts than the Rick Dom II, able to carry four on its bulky legs.
<p>
Further enhancing its ground combat capabilities, the Dom Funf is also able to be modified for combat in arid theatres. This modification, called the Dom Tropen, greatly enhances its versatility.

<b>H&L GB03K Mk. II 360mm Giant Bazooka</b> - Unlike the name suggests, this is not a bazooka in the truest sense of the word. Instead, it is in reality a recoilless cannon. The self-contained ammunition fires a sabot at extremely high speed towards the target; there is no explosive charge delivered, for the sheer penetration capabilities of the shell are more than enough to disable most mobile suits with a single shot.
<p>
<center><img src="ms-06fz-machinegun.jpg"></center>
<b>90mm MMP-80 machinegun.</b> Based off of the highly-successful MMP-80 early design used by the Dom, this 90mm is a larger, more durable weapon that about as powerful as the standard-issue MMP-78 rifle and certainly an improvement over the original ZMP-50D. As the current trend is going, it arms a grenade launcher at the front of its forward grip.
<p>
<center><img src="ms-09-heatsaber.jpg"></center>
<b>Heat saber</b> - Modeled after Federal beam sabers, its construction is relatively similar to most other Zeon superheated weaponry.
<p>
<center><img src="ms-06fz-sturmfaust.jpg"></center>
<b>Panzer Faust</b> - This miniature RPG like weapon packs an extreme punch, but lacks the accuracy of a bazooka or rocket launcher.
<p>
<center><img src="ms-09ftrop_bw.jpg"></center>
<b>Dom Tropen</b> - Dom Tropen. The Dom Funf can be easily modifed into a desert-capable mobile suit via the attachment of large sand filters and intake pipes over its jet engines, as well as additional coolant systems and radiators over its other joints. These are sometimes painted in brown camouflage colors.
