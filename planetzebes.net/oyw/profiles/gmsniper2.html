<td colspan="2"><p>While the Earth Federation's deployment of the original series of RGM-79 GMs and related variants proved a major upset to the Zeon Duchy's dominance of mobile suit warfare, Zeon was not far behind in producing a bevy of new and frightening mobile weapons to close the gap. Chiefly in response to the highly successful MS-09 Dom series and under considerable concern for future Zeon designs, the Federation embarked on additional rounds of mobile suit development based on the basic GM design. The top-tier product of these proceedings was the GM Sniper II, a high performance unit with an added capability for long-range engagements against enemy mobile suits.</p>
  <p>The GM Sniper II was developed concurrently with the RGM-79G GM Command, and shares many core components. The Sniper II is fitted with a totally redesigned backpack and four powerful thrusters in its legs, making it the most mobile Federation mobile suit of the war. Lightweight composite armor materials allowed the Sniper II to be relatively well armored while still maintaining a low overall mass, though it was still just as vulnerable to direct hits from heavy Zeon bazookas. It shared the GM Command's 90mm machine gun and beam rifle, shield, and skirt-mounted beam sabers. In spite of its &quot;sniper&quot; designation, the Sniper II is very nimble and can be expertly exploited in close-quarters combat.</p>
  <p>Though a perfectly capable general purpose mobile suit, the Sniper II is also provided for long-distance combat with a powerful sensor suite and a highly sensitive flip-down visor, significantly increasing the mobile suit's effective engagement range with normal weapons. The GM Command's 60mm vulcan guns were deleted in order to make space for the visor and over concerns of vibration damage to the sensitive sensor apparatuses. To allow the Sniper II to take the fullest advantage of its extended combat radius, a powerful semiautomatic sniper rifle was provided, allowing skilled pilots to disarm or disable enemy mobile suits by targeting weapons or other vulnerable points. <br>

<b>Sensor Suite and Visor </b> - By sacrificing peripheral vision and the total scanning area, the GM Sniper II can enable much greater accuracy over distance. A Sniper II's pilot can utilize any combination of precision high magnification, multi-spectrum scanning and a sophisticated rangefinder and motion detector.<br>
<br>
<center><img src="rgm79gbr.png" width="304" height="148">
</center>
<b>Beam Rifle  - </b>Somewhat weaker than the RX-78 Gundam's, a large conical E-Cap and improved cooling systems provide for a larger capacity and better rate of fire. With its small size, it is also quite handy and can be easily operated with one hand.<br>
<br>
<center><img src="rgm79gmg.png" width="247" height="150">
</center>
<b>90mm Machine Gun </b> - A standard ballistic armament of most GM-series mobile suits. Lightweight and compact, a rear-loading magazine (&quot;bullpup&quot; configuration) provides for surprising accuracy. Its magazine capacity is rather limited, however. <br>

    <b>Sniper Rifle  </b> - Manufactured to very tight tolerances, the GM Sniper II's rifle is a precision weapon firing a fin-stabilized sabot projectile. Though limited by a meager 5-round internal magazine, a well-trained sniper can easily exploit weak areas of enemy mobile suits while remaining virtually undetectable, a considerable drawback of comparable beam weapons. </td>
