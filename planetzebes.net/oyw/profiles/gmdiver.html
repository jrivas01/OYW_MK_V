 Upon development of the Duchy of Zeon's Jukon submarine and Gogg Marine Mobile Suit, the Federation was at somewhat of a loss in the naval campaign. The Jukon was easily able to sneak up to Federal battlegroups undetected, and the Gogg could tear a battleship in two with its hands.
<p>
The solution, in the eyes of Federal design specialists, was somewhat of a hurried one. Taking the frame of a then prototype RGM-79 GM, they proceeded to give it major surgury, completely replacing the head and backpack, and taking all the armor off of its arms. The backpack was exchanged with a similar one mounting hydrojet thrusters (similar thrusters were put into the feet) and the head mounted with something that looked oddly like a scuba-mask.
<p>
The resulting GM Diver, as it was affectionately named, was only slightly better than the Zeons failure MSM-01. While the lighter frame of the GM was aquatically sound (after removing the afformentioned armor plating), the hurried replacement of the thrusters, very non-hydrodynamic shape, and complete lack of underwater armament, made it almost useless once it got there.
<p>
To supplement this the prototype unit was sent back to the lab and the arms refitted again, the shoulders reshaped and made to arm an anti-ship torpedo apiece, for use against the Jukon submarine. An armor-piercing torpedo gun was also commissioned for the unit specifically with the Gogg in mind. Finally, a waterproofed version of the standard 90mm GM machinegun was added to its list of armaments, along with a set of underwater use "grenades", which really work more like Depth charges.
<p>
After a few test runs and the refitting of Himilaya class carriers to arm the units, the Federation had its answer to the duchy, albeit a hurried one.

<b>90mm machinegun</b> - Standard issue weapon for GM-type mobile suits. It is more compact and easier to manage than the Zaku's 120mm, but it lacks a substantial ammunition supply. The GM Divers 90mm has been modified with waterproofing materials, but is still designed for use on land.
<p>
<center><img src="rx-78-2-grenade.jpg" width=40%></center>
<b>Grenade</b> - More compact than Zeon issue grenades, with the same explosive power. The GM Divers grenades have been modified for underwater use.
<p>
<center><img src="rgm-79-shield.JPG"></center>
<b>Shield</b> - The GM's thinner armor is compensated by this large shield, which provides it excellent coverage and protection from enemy ballistics.
