After sucessfully throwing the Federation out of most of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Italy, Zeon mobile suit corps began experiencing their own problems on account of the poor arid conditions. Sand from blowing wind could easily immobilize an entire MS corps simply by clogging the joints of all its units. Furthermore, rampant cooling and overheating problems almost immediately sprung up, as the venerable MS-06J Zaku II was not intended for operation in extreme climates. Something would have to be done to achieve full efficiency.
<p>
Engineers at California Base successfully adapted an MS-06 Zaku II into a highly-successful variant, the MS-06D Desert Zaku. The Desert Zaku is fundamentally different from the stock model in a number of key ways. In addition to extensive sand filters to protect joins and reactor intake, its armor and physical appearance have been radically altered to give it the most optimal heat dispersion possible. The Desert Zaku's backpack has been replaced with a giant radiator to keep the mobile suit's internal heat under control. Additional thrusters have been installed in the mobile suit's legs to make up for those lost in the deletion of the backpack. The Desert Zaku's boost ability is actually somewhat higher than the stock Zaku II, presumably to assist it in getting out of inevitable hazardous terrain (running sand can easily innundate a mobile suit). A much larger antenna has also been provided, bolstering its communication ability even during a sandstorm.
<p>
The Desert Zaku is armed with a pair of 40mm vulcan guns in its head. It equips the same standard-issue Zaku weaponry as other models. As it is designed for high mobility even the worst environments, the Desert Zaku can also be equipped with a pair of jet skis that latch onto the bottom of its feet, allowing it to travel at high speed and with great mobility. They are only effective when used on smooth terrain (e.g. rolling sands of a desert), however. They can be promptly ejected if they become a hinderance in combat.

<b>Jet skis</b> - The Desert Zaku's feet are equipped with a pair of folding brackets that latch onto corresponding plugs on the top of each ski. This keeps the mobile suit firmly attached to the propulsion devices at even high speeds. They can be ejected at a moment's notice if the situation calls for it.
