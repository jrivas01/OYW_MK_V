Though production of Zaku-series mobile suits is beginning to taper off in the face of the newer heavy-assault Dom mobile suit, the Zeonic Corporation continues to punch back by improving old designs. Quite possibly the last Zaku variant to be produced, the Zaku Kai is a fine mobile suit.
<p>
The bulkier, tougher Zaku Kai is a greatly hiked-up design, featuring numerous improvements over the original MS-06F and J-types. A titanium/ceramic composite armor plating has been used, freeing up extra weight for the implementation of much more powerful thruster arrays. Standardized components allow Zaku Kai units to be repaired in the field using salvaged parts from older Zeon mobile suits, and its simplified interior makes every Zeon mechanic quite pleased. The only possible downside to the Zaku Kai is fuel consumption. It maintains a much higher thrust with the same fuel capacity, roughly halving its maximum sortie time.
<p>
The Zaku Kai's primary weapon is a 90mm machinegun stepped up from the popular MMP-80. This heavier weapon's combat prowess is about the same as the stock Zaku rifles in use by several mobile suit series, but is still somewhat lighter and eaiser to use. The usual retinue of heat hawk and grenades has been maintained.
<p>
Another boon to the Zaku Kai is the greatly increased armoring around the cockpit. This substantially improves pilot survivability in situations where the mobile suit has been completely disabled by enemy fire. Altogether, it is quite simply the best Zaku currently in production.

<b>90mm MMP-80 machinegun.</b> Based off of the highly-successful MMP-80 early design used by the Dom, the Zaku Kai's 90mm is a larger, more durable weapon that about as powerful as the standard-issue MMP-78 rifle and certainly an improvement over the original ZMP-50D. As the current trend is going, it arms a grenade launcher at the front of its forward grip.

<b>H&L-SB25K 280mm Zaku Bazooka </b> - 280mm "Zaku" bazooka. Same optical scope as the 120mm, with a rear-loading magazine.

<b>Type 5 Heat Hawk</b> - Heat hawk. A superheated hatchet for melee combat.

<b>Grenades</b> - Standard use Zaku grenade as well as the more infamous "Cracker" grenade.

<b>"German Helmet" design.</b> Many Zaku Kai units, especially those in use in the Homeland Defense Corps or in Gihren Zabi's personal "SS" contingent, are equipped with this alternate head design. It provides more protection for the vulnerable mono-eye and also reduces the total required materials in production. This design is standardized on the heavy assault Rick Dom II.
