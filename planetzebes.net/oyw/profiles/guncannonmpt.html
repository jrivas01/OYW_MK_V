Of the three pre-production Federation mobile suits, the RX-77 Guncannon lineup had the most success in achieveing mass production. The Gundam was deemed too costly (even though a limited number were built exclusively for land combat) and the Guntank failed to be versatile enough, but the Guncannon fit right in with the Federation's war policy.
<p>
The RX-77D Guncannon Mass Production Type is built off the same frame as the original Guncannon unit. It is not armored with the highly durable lunar titanium armoring as a cost cutting measure, but it is still quite tough in combat. Three gigantic thrusters on its backpack give it excellent mobility for such a heavy (by Federal standards) total weight, allowing it to quickly relocate while attacking an enemy at long range, and also offer a good reaction time in close-quarters combat.
<p>
The Guncannon MPT is armed with the traditional set of head-mounted vulcan guns. Its primary assault weapons are a set of collapsible 200mm artillery cannons. These have a heavy payload and are very accurate at range, as well as posess a good refire rate. The barrels fold and are stowed inside the Guncannon's backpack when not in use. The Guncannon MPT also carries standard GM weaponry to increase its ability to lay down a heavy suppressing barrage. While its reactor is sufficient to carry a full fledged beam rifle, due to supply issues very few Guncannon MPTs are equipped with them.

<b>100mm machinegun</b> - Standard issue weapon for GM-type mobile suits in Terrestrial environments. It is slightly more powerful than the 90mm and sports a larger ammunition capacity, but is slightly harder to handle.
<p>
<center><img src="rgm-79-beamspraygun.jpg"></center>
<b>Beam spray gun</b> - The EFFs mass produced beam weapon. Its short barrel and unsophisticated systems give it a short effective range compared to conventional armament, but it fires mega particles in a slight cone shape, giving it excellent accuracy; it is more of a shotgun than a rifle.
<p>

<b>Grenade</b> - More compact than Zeon issue grenades, with the same explosive power.
<p>
<center><img src="rx-77-cannons.jpg"></center>
<b>Cannons</b> - The Guncannon MPT sports several improvements over the original RX-77's designs, even though it is no longer equipped with Lunar titanium. A hydraulic stabilizing ram has been mounted on top of the barrels, helping to keep them still while firing, even if the Guncannon is moving. Furthermore, the barrels are also telescopic; when not in use, they can fold in on themselves and be neatly stowed inside the backpack, preventing damage from impact or other such situations.
