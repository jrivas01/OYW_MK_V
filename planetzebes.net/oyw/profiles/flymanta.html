A newer strike aircraft to the Federal Forces, the Fly Manta is one of many more recent designs that is gradually losing features of the archaic twentieth century units.
<p>
The Fly Manta is a multirole fighter-bomber, intended to be utilized against both air and ground targets. The Fly Manta's large engines and comparitively high thrust-to-weight ratio give it excellent speed, and substantial fuel stores give it a decent loiter time.
<p>
As an attack unit, the Fly Manta isn't so bad off. The usual quadrule 25mm machineguns have been replaced with two 40mm's. A pair of triple missile launchers serve as the Fly Manta's primary weapon system, and have been recorded as being capable of destroying Zeon mobile suits at close range.
<p>
Though it is fully capable of attacking ground targets, its low maximum altitude and lack of vertical-attack weaponry make it inferior for hitting well-entrenched enemy forces. Furthermore, it suffers a weak vitality, much like many other Federation aircraft. When high-altitude is necessary, or the attack will be delivered into heavily-defended enemy territory, such operations are best left to the Fly Manta's big brother, the Depp Rog.
<p>
As a fighter, it isn't quite as maneuverable as the older FF-6 Tin Cod, but its higher attack power make it attractive to Federal fighter aces for fighting mobile suits.
