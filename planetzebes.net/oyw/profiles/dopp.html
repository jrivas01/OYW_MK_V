The Dopp is much like the Magella Attack Tank in the sense that it is an oddball unit with high performance. The Dopp bears only a passing resemblance to traditional aircraft design with its raised cockpit and stubby body. This low-resistance design makes it extremely fast and nimble in combat; they are nearly impossible to shoot down by ground weaponry. Its cockpit offers exceptional visability, and it is not uncommon to see Dopps being used as forward observation units for calling in long-range attacks.
<p>
The Dopp's weapons are mounted inside a pair of pods on each side of the cockpit. It uses a wire-guidance system to bring its quick-tracking missiles on target, and also arms a set of 20mm guns for strafing ground targets or attacking enemy aircraft at close range.
<p>
The Dopp's chief weakness is its extremely high fuel consumption. Unlike most Federal aircraft, the Dopp's loiter time is ridiculously low. It is best used in combat scenarios where it can operate out of a Gaw assault carrier or a local airbase, as Dopps need to replenish their fuel tanks often to stay at full combat ability.
