As with many Federal non-mobile suit units, the Big Tray land battleship utilizes plenty of old technology. However, unlike the majority of said units, the Big Tray is a force to be reckoned with on the modern mobile suit battlefield.
<p>
Unlike Zeon's Dobay, which is, by all regards and classifications, a giant tank, the Big Tray is propelled by an air cushion under its body, something like that of a twentieth century LCAC. Though it is quite heavy, the Big Tray is fully capable of amphibious operations, and is quite mobile for a unit of its size. Though it isn't very fast, it can navigate tough terrain easily.
<p>
The Big Tray is intended for heavy attack; as such, it is armed primarily with large, powerful weapons. Two giant mega particle cannons are mounted on the Big Tray's front, designed for use against large land targets. Three triple-barreled cannons (modeled something after a battleship turret) are spread evenly across its hull, giving it very few blind spots. In a worst case scenario, the Big Tray can always simply crush anything trying to sneak up on it.
<p>
Though it is primarily a fire support unit or utilized as a forward command post, the Big Tray carries two squadrons of aircraft and a handful of mobile suits inside its hangar below the rear turret. Much as with the Dobay, these take time to deploy, however, due to the cramped space.
