Developed as a part of the 60's Rearmament Program, the FF-6 Tin Cod is a modern replacement for the F-22 Raptor that had been in service to the Earth Federation for nearly a century.
<p>
The Tin Cod is a smaller, faster, lighter, and cheaper aircraft than most of the twentieth-century designs in use by the Earth Federation up until that point. As such, it was easily mass-producable by the Federation's sturdy industrial plants, and virtually every base across the Earth was usually equipped with at least a squadron of Tin Cods.
<p>
The Tin Cod's primary armament is a pair of AMRAAM air-to-air missiles for hitting enemy aircraft quickly and efficiently. Of course, the standard four nose-mounted 25mm machineguns were maintained, though it was more by tradition at this point than anything else.
<p>
Following the invasion of Earth by the Zeon in March, Tin Cod squadrons kept in mind the horrendous failures of the FF-S3 Saberfish during the Lourm Campaign. Rather than blantantly attack Zeon mobile suits, as had been done in space, Tin Cods would usually try to lure Zeon's ever-present Zakus into ambushes where the Type 61 Main Battle Tanks could effectively engage the much more mobile Zeon units.
<p>
Following the deployment of thier own mobile suits, the Earth Federation is relying less on the Tin Cod to act as a primary attack unit and more as a platform for high-speed hit-and-run strikes against enemy targets.
