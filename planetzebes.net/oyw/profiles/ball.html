One of the chief machines utilized in colony construction is the SP-04W construction pod. The spherical hull is equipped with two arms and various assembly and repair gear, and is frequently seen at work along a colony's exterior.
<p>
Given the Federation's penchant for finding unusual weapons platforms, it wasn't long before they took the humble worker pod up for a design of their own. The RB-79 "Ball" as it is affectionately called is exactly that: an armed ball. The two manipulator arms were kept from the original construction pod design. A thin armor plating has been added across the hull, designed to give the Ball at least some rudimentary protection from enemy fire.
<p>
As a primary weapon, the Ball is equipped with a single 180mm recoiless cannon on a rotating base. Its rate of fire and accuracy leave something to be desired, but it is at least powerful enough to inflict significant damage against Zeon mobile suits.
<p>
Though originally intended to be their own attack units, the Ball's terrible speed and maneuverability had them quickly pulled back to act as point-defense units for Federation warships, freeing up otherwise engaged Saberfish fighters or GM mobile suits to fight the enemy.
