When the RX-78 Gundam was completed, it was intended purely as an initial-run testbed unit. The preliminary data acquired from the Gundam was used in construction of a pair of pre-production mobile suits: The RGM-79E for space combat, and the RGM-79[G] for land combat. However, the initial run of GM Ground Types still left a significant amount of lunar titanium left over. Federal engineers who obviously had far too much time on their hands took the remaining RGM-79[G] frames, and along with Tem Ray's plans for the original RX-78 Gundam, built a handful of their own.
<p>
The Gundam Mass Production Ground Type (GMPGT for short) is something of a misnomer in its own. Only a limited number were produced, and it was technically a GM as far as the mobile suit's internals were concerned. However, it still nevertheless managed to take the coveted name "Gundam" and the RX model designation in its own right.
<p>
The GMPGT sports many of the features of the GM Ground Type, including the new upper-torso cockpit location and lack of head-mounted vulcan guns. The latter was compensated for via the addition of a vulcan gun to the mobile suit's chest, and an optional gun pod that could be attached to the side of the Gundam's head. A "multilauncher" is also mounted in the chest in the same area as the vulcan. This unique weapon is used to fire grenades, decoy systems, and other ordinance. A specialized parachute pack is also armable, making the GMPGT excellent in paradrop operations.
<p>
The GMPGT is a specialized mobile suit intended for both normal and unconventional combat. For extended operations, the GMPGT's backpack has been flattened and modified to house a large weapons container, allowing it to carry any matter of armament in significant quantities. Other nifty technologies include a periscope, normally intended to help the GMPGT see around corners, and an optional larger sensor package for long-range observation (it is intended to be used in conjunction with the gun pod to maintain balanced weight).
<p>
Though, for once, the GMPGT actually has a reactor capable of powering a beam rifle, Federal engineers have yet to find a cost-effective method of mass producing one.

<b>Optional loadouts</b> - The GMPGT can mount multiple additional packages for unconventional warfare on its flattened backpack. The first, a large storage container, can mount spare parts, huge amounts of ammunition, and additional weapons for all manners of combat. The second, a parachute pack, gives the GMPGT extreme mobility during paradrop operations, as well as acts as a limited booster to assist the heavy unit.

<center><img src="rx-79g-machinegun.jpg"></center>
<b>100mm machinegun</b> - Standard issue weapon for GM-type mobile suits in Terrestrial environments. It is slightly more powerful than the 90mm and sports a larger ammunition capacity, but is slightly harder to handle.
<p>
<center><img src="rx-79g-beamrifle.jpg"></center>
<b>Beam rifle</b> - A full fledged beam rifle. Long range, accurate and with a 20 round charge, it is unquestioningly better than the beam spray gun.
<p>
<center><img src="rx-79g-beamsaber.jpg"></center>
<b>Beam saber</b> - The same sword-type weapon used by nearly all Federation mobile suits. The GM Ground Type is armed with two beam sabers in the same tradition as the Gundam. The GM Ground Type's are mounted in concealed hatches on the sides of its knees.
<p>
<center><img src="rx-78-2-grenade.jpg" width=40%></center>
<b>Grenade</b> - More compact than Zeon issue grenades, with the same explosive power.
<p>
<center><img src="rgm-79-bazooka.jpg"></center>
<b>305mm bazooka</b> - Heavy assault weapon based on the RX-78's original Hyper Bazooka. Highly accurate and quick to reload, but it lacks the higher payload of Zeon's 360mm Giant Bazooka.
<p>
<center><img src="rx-79gez-8-shield.jpg"></center>
<b>arm shield</b> - Although not as large as more traditional shields, ground models equip this luna titanium "arm shield", which is impervious to conventional fire at all but close range, and has a toothlike front that can crush weaker armor materials when used as a weapon.
