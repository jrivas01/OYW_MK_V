In order to provide long-range firepower superior to even the Zaku Cannon's, the MS-16M Xamel was contrived. It looks less like a mobile suit and more like a tank than anything else of its kind, and its giant howitzer is a force to be reckoned with.
<p>
The Xamel is propelled much in the same was as the Dom series, and mounts a thermonuclear hover jet in each leg and several in its giant skirt. It is well armored, and has the same dust filters and sand protection gear as the Dom Funf desert combat variant. This allows it to quickly enter combat, deploy, fire a salvo, then get moving again before the enemy can locate its position.
<p>
The Xamel's primary weapon is a massive 680mm artillery cannon. It is extremely accurate and can easily hit targets well over fourty-five kilometers away. Intended to destroy reinforced bunkers and land battleships, needless to say a Federal mobile suit would be wrecked beyond capacity. An eight-tube missile launcher, capable of firing long and short range missiles, rotates out of a storage bay on its left shoulder. Finally, a 20mm vulcan gun is mounted on a turret on top of the Xamel's flat head. Its scrawny arms sometimes carry a Dom's 360mm giant bazooka.
<p>
It's intended more for long-range support, but its thick armor and tamendous mass alone make it a substantial threat to mobile suits attempting to engage it in close range.

<b>H&L GB03K 360mm Giant Bazooka</b> - Standard-issue weapon for an MS-09 Dom, Xamels occassionally use them for point defense.
<p>

<b>680mm cannon</b> - This tramendous weapon fires slowly, but is very accurate and powerful. It is usually folded and stored behind its back, and deployed over its head and slightly to the right.

<b>Cockpit</b> - The Xamel is a two-seater, unlike most mobile suits. The pilot (in front) controls the Xamel's movement and its secondary weapons, and the gunner (in back) is responsible for aiming and firing the artillery cannon.
