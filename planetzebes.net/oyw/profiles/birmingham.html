The newest and unquestionably strongest ship in the Earth Federation Space Force, the Birmingham-class is truly a beast of epic proportions.
<p>
The Birmingham is a huge leap forward for the Federation's "big ship, big gun" policy towards warfare. Though many of the new breed of Salamis and Magellan-class ships are now carrying their own mobile suit contingents, the Birmingham relies purely on its repugnant amount of firepower to take down the enemy. As one might imagine, this is a rare ship used exclusively for fleet commanders.
<p>
Each of the Birmingham's five gigantic main cannons has as much firepower as an entire Salamis-class cruiser; that in and of itself puts the Birmingham at a respectable position. Four smaller turrets are placed behind the main armaments, and the usual cadre of antiaircraft laser turrets is featured in spades. Heavy missile launchers are mounted in the ship's front, and a pair of large missile pods are mounted behind the bridge. However, its already impressive armament is bolstered by a single, massive mega particle cannon mounted under the ship's bow. The weapon's barrel runs half the length of the ship's hull; it is so large that it is actually not turreted at all. The entire ship must rotate to fire the humongous cannon at a target. Despite a slow rate of fire, the main cannon is expected knock the fight out of the Zeon's yet-undefeated Gwazine with two or three shots.
<p>
Fun Vlad Fact: The Birmingham's successful design would later be used by the Titans to make their powerful Dogos Gear carrier.
