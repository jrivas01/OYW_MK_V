<p>
Supplementary to the Jukon-class submarine, the Zeon wet navy needed to further their naval war machine with a large vessel to fill a number of roles in combat. The Mad Angler-class, as it became to be known, did all of these quite nicely.
<p>
As a submarine tender, the Mad Angler is intended to help keep Jukon-class submarines supplied and armed in the field. Its two observation towers can be used to dock with Jukons while underwater and covertly transfer cargo and personnell.
<p>
As a combat vessel, the Mad Angler fills a heavy attack role. Rather than be swift and nimble like a Jukon, the Mad Angler strives for pure firepower. For attacking land targets, the Mad Angler is equipped with ten long-range surface-to-surface vertical-launch missile bays. Originally intended to deliver nuclear weapons, they now usually carry a conventional payload. For marine combat, the Mad Angler is armed with nine torpedo launchers, all clustered around the bow and forward-facing. The Mad Angler is intended for the transport and fielding of heavy firepower, and it is no exception in either front.
<p>
As a transport craft, the Mad Angler is supreme yet again. Its gargantuan hold can carry twelve marine mobile suits, and it is still capable of underwater deployment. Additionally, a special section of the hangar is devoted entirely towards the storage and maintainence of the new Grabro-class marine mobile armor.
