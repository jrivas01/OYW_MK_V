During the early years of the Zeon Duchy it became apparent that a war of independance against the Earth Federation would require a new weapons platform to fight the Federation's massive war machine. MIP's X1 space fighter was killed off in favor of a humanoid design, which seemed to be the ideal platform for a high-maneuverability unit on both space and land. The fourth design, the MS-04, was the first one to equip a Minovsky ultracompact reactor, and the MS-05 was the first to carry the famous Zaku name.
<p>
The MS-05A Zaku I served as the Zeon Duchy's security force during the prewar years leading up to 0079. It was also the standard trainer mobile suit, and continues to do so today. However, by the time war erupted on January 1st, enough advances had been made to warrant a new frontline mobile suit, the MS-06 Zaku II, which would spawn numerous variants. The original MS-05A Zaku Is were relegated to utility work, and also to administer the deadly G3 gas to targeted space colonies during Operation British. After the end of the Lourm Campaign, some of the MS-05A's were converted into combat-ready MS-05B's. Originally intended for reserves, these older Zakus eventually found their way to the frontlines via various means.
<p>
The MS-05's primitive initial weaponry was upgraded with the Zaku II's, and supplementary armor, coupled with a few additional thrusters put it at a similar level to the newer MS-06's. However, it retained its hand-carried version of the Zaku's shoulder shield, and was always known for having a slightly faster response time, making it somewhat more popular with older pilots (for instance, the Space Assault Force's "Blue Giant" Captain Ramba Ral).
<p>
Now that the war has been going on for some time, many Zaku I's have been stolen, sold to the Riah Republic or JDEG, or have otherwise found their way to the black market. This is one of the most commonly used mobile suits by Rogue agents in 0079.
