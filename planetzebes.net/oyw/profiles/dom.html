Upon news of the Federation's institution of its own mobile suit program, Zeon engineers commenced work on a new type of mobile suit. While the MS-07 Gouf, an offshoot of the MS-06 Zaku, acted as a stopgap, Zeon R&D began cranking out the new MS-09 series. Later to be named 'Dom' the MS-09 was a radical new approach to mobile suits.
<p>
The Dom makes use of a pair of huge thermonuclear jet engines in its oversized legs to generate a cushion of air under its feet; it hovers above the ground and moves at great speed with a skiing-like motion. The Dom is thusly capable of quick maneuvering and a high overall speed in combat, giving it an unprescedented advantage over other conventional mobile suits. To compensate for the increased energy drain, the Dom was provided with a much improved reactor and thicker armor plating than the earlier Zaku and Gouf series.
<p>
The Dom also sports a host of weaponry, including the powerful 360mm Giant Bazooka, and the Federal-inspired heat saber. Dom mobile suits also mounted a scattering beam gun in their torsos, designed to produce an extremely bright flash of light to blind enemy pilots.
<p>
Minor modifications of the Dom's power systems and an interchangable set of lower legs allow for space deployment; these models are known as Rick Doms.
