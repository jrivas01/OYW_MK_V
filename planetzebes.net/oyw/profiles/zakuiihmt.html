During the interim months between the end of Operation British and the deployment of Federal mobile suits, Zeon engineers continued tinkering away with their venerable MS-06 series of Zaku II mobile suits. While terrestrial designers were hard at work preparing their MS-09 Dom series (and stopgap MS-07 Gouf), the research crew at Solomon came up with a new and improved Zaku design until something better came their way. This new Zaku sports massively improved thruster output and maneuverability, among other things.
<p>
Though it still uses the same basic frame as the MS-06F, the MS-06R1A sports a vastly improved reactor, a lighter weight and greatly increased rocket output. It is also much more standardly armed with Panzer fausts, a favorite weapon of Dozles crew.
<p>
This high-performance variant is quite expensive to produce, and is usually only issued to seasoned officers. This is also for health concerns, as the Zaku HMT's expanded output is sometimes greater than green pilots can bear. This was the favored space unit of the infamous Black Tri-Stars, an upgrade from their earlier Zaku I B models.
