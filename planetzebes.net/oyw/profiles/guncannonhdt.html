Despite Jaburo base's relative security due to its concealed location, a number of Federal tacticians still had a great deal of apprehension regarding the possibility of Zeon Marine Mobile Suits breaking into the hidden base and causing chaos. As a means of complementing the base's already massive defense forces, a handful of unique Guncannon-type mobile suits were developed.
<p>
These units, referred to as "Harbor Defense Types" were only a minor modification of the Guncannon massed production type. One of their twin 200mm cannons has been removed and replaced with a mount for eight vertically-firing ASROCs (AntiSubmarine ROCket). After firing, the ASROCs flip over in flight, strike the water at high speed, and home in on the cavitation signature of the expected enemy targets. To this extent, the Harbor Defense Guncannons are intended for use as first-response units to enemy incursion. Their blue paintjob signifies them from the normal red of both stock and Mass Production Guncannons.
<p>
While they have no real underwater combat ability, the HDT is purely designed to assist underwater operations, primarily defence - It's ASROCs can be targetted in such a way to be a great assistance to GM Divers and GM Aquas, and in addition, the Guncannon itself is a good match for a Gogg once it has reached the surface, due to its heavy armament and armor.
<p>
However, the Guncannon Harbor Defence Type can also be used as a medium range Ground combat support unit. Aside from the lack of one cannon, its combat performance is essentially equal to that of a Guncannon Massed Production Type.

<b>100mm machinegun</b> - Standard issue weapon for GM-type mobile suits in Terrestrial environments. It is slightly more powerful than the 90mm and sports a larger ammunition capacity, but is slightly harder to handle.
<p>
<center><img src="rgm-79-beamspraygun.jpg"></center>
<b>Beam spray gun</b> - The EFFs mass produced beam weapon. Its short barrel and unsophisticated systems give it a short effective range compared to conventional armament, but it fires mega particles in a slight cone shape, giving it excellent accuracy; it is more of a shotgun than a rifle.
<p>
<center><img src="rx-78-2-grenade.jpg" width=40%></center>
<b>Grenade</b> - More compact than Zeon issue grenades, with the same explosive power.
<p>
<center><img src="rx-77-cannons.jpg"></center>
<b>Cannons</b> - The Guncannon MPT sports several improvements over the original RX-77's designs, even though it is no longer equipped with Lunar titanium. A hydraulic stabilizing ram has been mounted on top of the barrels, helping to keep them still while firing, even if the Guncannon is moving. Furthermore, the barrels are also telescopic; when not in use, they can fold in on themselves and be neatly stowed inside the backpack, preventing damage from impact or other such situations.
