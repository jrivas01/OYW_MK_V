Widely regarded as the most underappreciated mobile suit of the original three Project V mobile suits, the Guntank, being hardly a mobile suit at all, rarely recieves any credit. Despite this, following limited-production runs of scaled down Gundam and Guncannon units, some voices inside the Federation Army pushed for a Guntank production as well. The result of this lobbying was the drastically reworked Guntank Mass Production Type.
<p>
In comparison to the original, the Guntank MPT is almost an entirely different mobile suit. Firstly, the complicated and expensive Core Block System, incorporating an FF-X7 Core Fighter, was deleted from the design all together. However, this also allowed the new model Guntank to rotate at the waist, giving it a much greater firing arc. The armor around the torso was substantially increased, providing extra protection for the driver inside the Guntank's hull. Additionally, the self-contained ammunition magazines were replaced with a large, exposed container on the Guntank's back which would lower into the proper position before firing. This also made it possible for the ammunition to be reloaded mid-combat, essentially allowing the Guntank to continually dump its howitzers at a target. Finally, the limited-capacity missile launchers in the Guntank's arms were replaced with quadruple large-caliber vulcan guns.
<p>
A fun little addition, the Guntank can also be equipped with a pair of high-tension crane arms in place of its howitzers to serve as a recovery unit for disabled mobile suits.
