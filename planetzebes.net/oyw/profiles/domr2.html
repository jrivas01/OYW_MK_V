Based off reports of strong successes from their MS-09R Rick Doms in the field, Zimmad Corporation continued the further refinement of their Dom series with two new mobile suits: the MS-09F Dom Funf, a universal mobile suit for both space and land combat, and the MS-09R2 Rick Dom II, a heavy assault mobile suit intended exclusively for space combat.
<p>
Unlike its predecessors, the Rick Dom II has no exchange components for terrestrial combat; it is a space combat unit through and through, and it is refined to the nth degree. The Rick Dom II retains the heavy armor and high-speed abilities of the older Dom units, and is also provided with numerous apogee motors to improve zero-G combat maneuverability. A pair of large external propellant tanks have been generously added to offset the much higher fuel consumption, giving the Rick Dom II excellent capabilities in long-range missions.
<p>
The Rick Dom II's primary weapon is the fearsome Improved Giant Bazooka. This high-velocity weapon is capable of accurately downing mobile suits at significant distances, usually with only one shot. As off-hand weapons, the Rick Dom II equips the Zaku Kai's 90mm machinegun, a traditional Dom heat saber, and many pilots equip Panzerfausts, the RDII's large legs being able to mount four instead of the traditional two.
<p>
Among other things, the Rick Dom II retains the "German Helmet" design featured on some Zaku Kai units. An interesting note about the RDII is that models given to different divisions are painted different colors. The SAF retains the traditional Black Trinity colored models, while the MAF and SS are issued a new black-red-green colorscheme.

<b>H&L GB03K Mk. II 360mm Giant Bazooka</b> - Unlike the name suggests, this is not a bazooka in the truest sense of the word. Instead, it is in reality a recoilless cannon. The self-contained ammunition fires a sabot at extremely high speed towards the target; there is no explosive charge delivered, for the sheer penetration capabilities of the shell are more than enough to disable most mobile suits with a single shot.
<p>
<center><img src="ms-06fz-machinegun.jpg"></center>
<b>90mm MMP-80 machinegun.</b> Based off of the highly-successful MMP-80 early design used by the Dom, this 90mm is a larger, more durable weapon that about as powerful as the standard-issue MMP-78 rifle and certainly an improvement over the original ZMP-50D. As the current trend is going, it arms a grenade launcher at the front of its forward grip.

<b>Heat saber</b> - Modeled after Federal beam sabers, its construction is relatively similar to most other Zeon superheated weaponry.
