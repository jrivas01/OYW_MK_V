Following the complete and utter failure of the GM Diver, Federal R&D staff set out to try and save at least some of their dignity with a mobile suit that could at least hold a candle to the murderous crab-like Zeon Marine Mobile Suits.
<p>
Following a great deal of wasted budget funds and numerous mobile suits being left on the bottom of the Amazon River, Federal engineers finally rolled out a suitable model: the RAG-79 Aqua GM. Unlike the earlier GM Diver, the Aqua GM focused on being in the water full-time; a premise not unlike the Zeon's MSM-03 Gogg.
<p>
Rather than amphibious operations, the Aqua GM was constructed with the intention of being an anti-mobile suit unit. Its armament consists almost entirely of torpedo-type weapons; its sole equipment otherwise is a single surface-to-surface missile launcher, intended to bombard seashore bases once their MSMs had been dealt with, to remove the necessity of going ashore.
<p>
Its primary weapon are two sets of quadruple torpedo launchers, mounted in the mobile suit's shoulders. Intended chiefly to down other marine mobile suits, they don't carry much payload but are slightly faster in the water than some Zeon models. For attacking heavier targets, two large torpedoes are provided on the mobile suits forearms. Finally, for close-range combat, four miniature beam sabers (their blades are styled in the shape of a pick) are mounted at the mobile suit's skirt armor for quick access.
<p>
In addition, the GM Divers old underwater use machinegun and grenades are armable, for use in massed operations and in case of an aquatic landing. However, these are intended to not be necessary.
<p>
In actual combat the GM Aqua turned out to be an amazing success, boasting more speed, maneuverability and firepower than the Duchy's MSM-03 Gogg underwater. Its amphibious capabilities are next to nothing, but it didn't need to go ashore thanks to its ability to assist Ground Based operations via the missile launcher.
<p>
It also corrects the Gogg, Acquy and Z'Goks major flaw - though they can only move underwater vertically, they have to fire horizontally, forcing them to stop moving in order to fire (the Hygogg and Z'Gok E later corrected this problem.) The GM Aqua can fire all of its armament while moving straight at its target.
<p>
The only thing it cannot compete with the Gogg on the same level of, unfortunately, is armor, still having the simple armor of the GM frame.

<b>90mm machinegun</b> - Standard issue weapon for GM-type mobile suits. It is more compact and easier to manage than the Zaku's 120mm, but it lacks a substantial ammunition supply. The Aqua GM's 90mm has been modified with waterproofing materials, but is still designed for use on land.

<b>Grenade</b> - More compact than Zeon issue grenades, with the same explosive power. The Aqua GM's grenades have been modified for underwater use.

<b>Alternate Rollout</b> - Depending on whether or not this GM is manufactured at Jaburo, Belfast or Honolulu, it can be modelled after either of these variants. Note the differences in the head, as well as the more pronounced chest armor.
