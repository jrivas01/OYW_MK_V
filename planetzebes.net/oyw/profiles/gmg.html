When the RX-78 Gundam was completed, it was intended purely as an initial-run testbed unit. The data acquired from the V project tests was used in construction of a pair of pre-production mobile suits: The RGM-79E for space combat, and the RGM-79[G] for land combat. The GM Ground Type, as it was thusly named, was in many ways a slightly scaled-down Gundam without the technology for use in space combat. The GM Ground Type's heavy armor and substandard thruster output makes it more of a tank than the later-model RGM-79, and while it isn't quite as maneuverable, it makes up for it with its durability.
<p>
The GM Ground Type is armored with lunar titanium, making it extremely resilient against ballistic weapons fire. The Gundam's two beam sabers have been moved into armored storage racks on the GM's knees, making for easy access in cramped quarters. This GM is armed with the same stock 90mm machinegun and 305mm bazooka as most GMs, while the trademark dual 60mm head-mounted vulcans have been removed.
<p>
Giving the GM Ground Type's tough lunar titanium armoring, the large tower shield present on most other GMs has been replaced with a much smaller shield primarily intended for blocking melee weapons. Once again, however, the GM Ground Type's subpar reactor output denies it the use of a beam rifle, leaving that still a luxury purely for the RX-78. On the bright side, the GM Ground Type is equipped with arid combat gear, allowing it to function at top efficiency in desert and tropical environments.

<b>arm shield</b> - Although not as large as more traditional shields, ground models equip this luna titanium "arm shield", which is impervious to conventional fire at all but close range, and has a toothlike front that can crush weaker armor materials when used as a weapon.

<b>100mm machinegun</b> - Standard issue weapon for GM-type mobile suits in Terrestrial environments. It is slightly more powerful than the 90mm and sports a larger ammunition capacity, but is slightly harder to handle.
<p>
<center><img src="rx-79g-beamsaber.jpg"></center>
<b>Beam saber</b> - The same sword-type weapon used by nearly all Federation mobile suits. The GM Ground Type is armed with two beam sabers in the same tradition as the Gundam. The GM Ground Type's are mounted in concealed hatches on the sides of its knees.

<b>Grenade</b> - More compact than Zeon issue grenades, with the same explosive power.
<p>
<center><img src="rgm-79-bazooka.jpg"></center>
<b>305mm bazooka</b> - Heavy assault weapon based on the RX-78's original Hyper Bazooka. Highly accurate and quick to reload, but it lacks the higher payload of Zeon's 360mm Giant Bazooka.
