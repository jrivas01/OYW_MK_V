Zeon R&D, expecting to encounter heavy resistance from Federal air power, began to contrive a Zaku variant with a rapid-firing vulcan gun on its right shoulder. This was given the designation of MS-06K, and development continued at the Zeon's newly-occupied California Base. Later, when it became apparent that the Federation had its own mobile suit development program, the vulcan gun was scrapped in favor of a large, accurate ballistic cannon that would presumably be used for direct fire against these new machines.
<p>
The Zaku Cannon is an unusual variant. Though it uses the standard J-type Zaku's frame, its external body has been completely remade, and sports numerous additional maneuvering thrusters, a much larger shield, and a redesigned head and torso with a 360-degree mono-eye. Extra armor is added to its legs to counterbalance the cannon's recoil. The Zaku's backpack is also ejectable, allowing it to discard the heavy cannon when mobility or a quick escape is needed. It arms the basic Zaku weaponry for close-range combat.
<p>
The Zaku Cannon's gun is also capable of long-range indirect fire, and is quite deadly when in a strategic location and paired with a forward spotting unit. However, the Zaku must be in a stationary, half-crouching position to fire without risking falling over. Furthermore, all Zaku Cannons are also equipped with efficient heat dispersion gear, allowing them to function moderately well in arid environments.
