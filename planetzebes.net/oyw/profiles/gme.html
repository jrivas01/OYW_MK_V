Shortly before the first inadvertant deployment of the RX-78 Gundam, the Federation took the preliminary data from the Gundam and used it to produce two new testbed mobile suit series: the RGM-79[G] GM Ground Type, and the RGM-79E GM Space Type. The Ground Type took the principle of land warfare to the fullest, including lunar titanium armor and heavy weapons, and the Space Type took the Federation's knowledge of the Gundam's tactics in space and put it into a standardized package.
<p>
The Space Type GM, while not as heavily armed or armored as its land based counterpart, is still a notch above the Zeon's MS-06F Zaku II. Its lighter weight and improved armoring also makes it more maneuverable than competeting mobile suits. However, unlike the GM Ground Type, which is an extremely powerful mobile suit, the Space Type is much more of the testbed it was meant to be. It isn't much better than the mass production RGM-79 GM, and its land combat capability is significantly inferior. Also, it is not armed with the usual GM's bazooka, as the rushed production did not have time to incorporate the bazooka's telemetry and targeting data.
<p>
Much as with other GMs, they are not equipped with a reactor powerful enough to equip a full-sized beam rifle, so they must make do with standard ballistics.

<b>90mm machinegun</b> - Standard issue weapon for GM-type mobile suits. It is more compact and easier to manage than the Zaku's 120mm, but it lacks a substantial ammunition supply.

<b>Beam saber</b> - The same sword-type weapon used by nearly all Federation mobile suits. The GM is equipped with one to cut costs and increase production time.

<b>Grenade</b> - More compact than Zeon issue grenades, with the same explosive power.

<b>Shield</b> - The GM's thinner armor is compensated by this large shield, which provides it excellent coverage and protection from enemy ballistics.
