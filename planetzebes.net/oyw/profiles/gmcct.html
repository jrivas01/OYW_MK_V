Developed shortly after the deployment of the basic RGM-79 GM, the D-type was initially made out to be a general purpose high-performance unit. However, its creation also brought out a glaring fault in the Federation war machine: if faced with hostile arctic climates, none of their mobile suits would be able to operate effectively. On the other hand, Zeon's new MS-09 Dom series mobile suits generate more than enough heat to keep themselves from freezing over in the cold.
<p>
To this extent, the in-production RGM-79D type was further modified into a Cold Climate variant, providing it with extra antifreeze tanks and heating rings all over the mobile suit's critical junctures and components. The result was the GM Cold Climate Type, and it was quickly deployed to such arctic environments as the Augustus Research Base.
<p>
Technically speaking, the GM Cold Climate Type bolsters the original GM's combat characteristics. A larger backpack and improved thrusters give it greater boosting capabilities, and the newer titanium/ceramic composite armor give it much more survivability in combat.
<p>
The GM Cold Climate Type also recieved a special machinegun equipped with a grenade launcher and other devices intended to prevent ammunition from freezing inside the weapon. The stock armament was maintained otherwise.
<p>
Naturally, as with most GMs, it still lacks a beam rifle, though this is also due to the environment in which it operates, requiring even more energy to keep the e-cap functioning.

<b>90mm machinegun</b> - This unusual-looking weapon is a marked departure from traditional Federal designs. Rather than the usual "Bullpup" design with a rear-loading magazine, this machinegun is styled more or less after the Sten submachinegun. Not to be outdone by comparitive Zeon models, it is also armed with a grenade launcher. Miniature heating rings are built into the machinegun's reciever to keep the ammunition from freezing inside the gun during arctic operations.
<p>

<b>Beam spray gun</b> - The EFFs mass produced beam weapon. Its short barrel and unsophisticated systems give it a short effective range compared to conventional armament, but it fires mega particles in a slight cone shape, giving it excellent accuracy; it is more of a shotgun than a rifle.
<p>
<center><img src="rgm-79-beamsaber.jpg"></center>
<b>Beam saber</b> - The same sword-type weapon used by nearly all Federation mobile suits. The GM is equipped with one to cut costs and increase production time. 
<p>

<b>Grenade</b> - More compact than Zeon issue grenades, with the same explosive power.
<p>
<center><img src="rgm-79g-shield.jpg" width=50%></center>
<b>Shield</b> - The GM's thinner armor is compensated by this large shield, which provides it excellent coverage and protection from enemy ballistics. The GM CCT's shield has the added bonus of storing two extra clips for its 90mm machinegun.
