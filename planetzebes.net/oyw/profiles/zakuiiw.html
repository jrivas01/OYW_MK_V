Mobile suits, because of their powerful reactors, ability to operate in nearly every known environment, and manipulable limbs, made them useful not only for war, but also for labor. While the Zaku line was originally created to be a war machine, the rollout of the Zaku II C put a lot of old Zaku IA models into the proverbial attic. Needing something to do with their older machines at the same time as they were gaining a vast amount of new territory, many old Zaku I's were transformed into the MS-06W.
<p>
While it used the MS-06 model number and many MS-06 parts, the Worker Zaku was more a Zaku I than a Zaku II. These suits were used in Western Asia during the One Year War, as well as for the construction of space colonies in Side 3. The existing cockpit was altered and constructed from a cockpit of a worker vehicle, and had an overhang like the MS-06V Zaku Tank. A winch was attached to the left arm and the right arm had a shovel. Because the Principality was worried about a shortage of resources they shifted their efforts towards the Zaku Tank later in the war, which used many of the same parts. However, many Worker Zaku's remained in service up until the end of the war.
<p>
While it is a labor use unit, the Duchy of Zeon was still hesitant to sell its mobile suits to third parties. After the signing of the Antarctic Treaty however, the sudden need for resources for the Earth Invasion operation prompted the sale of many of the then new MS-06W models, and several found their way into the hands of the JDEG, CMC, LMC, and Riah Republic. Some would go to the Black Market as well, and many would be seen operated by Rogues, equipped with stolen heat hawks from military models.
