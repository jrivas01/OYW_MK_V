After the Earth Drop operations failure to capture the EF bases at Malta and Honolulu, an ambitious new project sprung up at California Base to convert the MS-06J Zaku II into a suitable marine combat mobile suit. The resulting prototype, the MS-06M (later reclassified as Mobile Suit Marine 01; MSM-01) was an astounding failure in every forseeable fashion. The Zaku's body, even after undergoing substantial modification, was just not hydrodynamic enough to be worthwhile, so an entirely new mobile suit design would have to be constructed. Zimmad, eager to smudge out their Zeonic rivals, spared some of their Dom researchers to crank out a mobile suit later to be called the MSM-03 Gogg.
<p>
The Gogg is an extremely portly mobile suit due to its stomach mounted weapons. Two heavy mega particle cannons give it some serious firepower, and a pair of torpedo launchers allow it to engage targets underwater at long range. Its long and highly flexible arms are also equipped with long, sharp claws with limited manipulator capability. Two anti-ship torpedos can also be mounted on the Goggs backpack.
<p>
The Gogg is outfitted with a large reactor to power its mega particle cannons. It is also heavily armored, both to withstand enemy fire as well as the crushing pressures exerted by the ocean and deep depths. However, the Gogg suffers from overheating problems as a result of its water-cooled reactor, and can only fight on land at full power for about twenty to thirty minutes before needing to shut down and cool off or get back in the water. Also, its belly-mounted weaponry isn't nearly as easy to aim as a normal, handheld gun, which has drawn some fire from Zeon's older mobile suit pilots as too much of a breach of continuity and tradition.

<b>Mega Particle Cannon</b> - The first mobile suit equipped with an internal mega particle cannon, the Goggs cannons use two different power settings, a full power setting or the depicted half power setting, due to reactor heating concerns. While the full power setting is usable outside of an aquatic theatre, it will quickly overheat the suit and force the reactor to shut down. Underwater the Gogg can use the MPCs at full capacity without concern. Although the half-power setting is considerably weaker, it is still more than powerful enough to deal with most Federal armor, having trouble only with Luna Titanium.

<b>Freeze Yard</b> - Zeon MSMs can arm specialized torpedos that fire a substance oddly named "Freeze Yard". This sticky gelatin makes them essentially immune to conventional minefields. However, the substance itself is extremely expensive, and is only issued for important missions.
