<br>
The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean on Earth and served as the battlefield to some of the most deadliest wars in humanity's history.  Fully covering a third of the Earth's surface, the Pacific Ocean can be the perfect place to disappear into.
<br><br>
Which is what the crew of the <i>Viktoria Luise</i> is trying to do on its journey to California Base.  Like the other Gaws that evacuated from Odessa, the purple airplane is damaged and carrying whatever and whoever could be loaded onboard from the former Zeon fortress.
<br><br>
One of these people is the prominent Garma Zabi.  Youngest of the Zabi family members, the commander of the Terrestrial Assault Force twirled his purple hair as he pondered the situation.  The latest Earth Federal ground offensive is a serious setback to his ambition to be the successor of the Zabi family.  His frown is about to be interrupted by more bad news.
<br><br>
The bulkhead door swung open as a junior officer shouted in alarm.  "My lord!  Federal aircraft have been sighted!"

<br>
There is no plan.  But then again, the goal is pretty simple.  The crew of the Dish aircraft that spotted the Zeon Gaw called up the fighters of the 101st Fighter Division.  The six Tin Cods went to afterburner as they banked in formation towards their target.  Off in the distance, another Dish relayed the contact to three Don Escargots who joined in on the attack.
<br><br>
The skies aren't so lonely for the <i>Viktoria Luise</i>, however.  Two Dopps peeled away from the Gaw as they dove towards the attackers.  The Tin Cod pilots aren't exactly cadets but the two Dopps heading their way are no ordinary flyers.  White mist spilled over the brown airframe of Garma Zabi's Dopp as he flew through a cloud.
<br><br>
"<i>Hey princess</i>," taunts Iceman from his Dopp," <i>I'll take the four on the left.</i>"
<br><br>
"<i>Why don't you take the two on the right and leave the rest</i>?" retorts Garma.
<br><br>
"<i>You're not that fast.  Ah, here we go.</i>"
<br><br>
"<i>The only thing faster-</i>."
<br><br>
"<i>-Is light.</i>"
<br><br>
"<i>Exactly.</i>"
<br><br>
Two of the Federal Tin Cods turned towards the two ace Dopp pilots in an effort to hold them off while the others attack the Gaw.  The two Tin Cod pilots barely lived long enough to register surprise as Iceman and Garma blotted them out of the sky with ease.
<br><br>
The rest of the fight was chaotic to the Dish crews who were trying to orchestra the attack but found it difficult with both Garma and Iceman so close between the Federal planes.  One by one the Tin Cods fell, the last of which was caught between the AA guns of the <i>Viktoria Luise</i> and Garma's vulcans.
<br><br>
The much slower moving Don Escargots and Dishes were hardly a challenge for the two Dopps and ended up being a minor footnote in this battle.
<br><br>
By the time Garma landed back onboard the Gaw, he felt as if a heavy load was lifted from his shoulders.  All the Federal attackers managed to accomplish is to let Garma vent out the stress left from the Battle of Odessa.
