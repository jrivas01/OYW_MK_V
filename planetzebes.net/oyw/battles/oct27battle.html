<br><br>
"You remember the plan right?" Rhett heard Markos ask over the comm. Rhett nodded to himself as he replied "Yes Markos. I provide covering fire, while you engage the target." Markos's only response as his suit flashed by was "For the glory of Zeon." Rhett nodded as he settled his Zaku K into a firing position. A little ways off to his right Rhett noticed the Zaku K from Markos's team doing the same. As if on cue both suits opened fire launching their initial barrage off into the distance.
<br><br>
If their was one thing Jarvis hated about Cambodia, it would be the heat. Even in the cockpit of his GM Command the feeling of it was oppressive. His musing were interrupted as cannon rounds fell screaming from the sky, and impacted all around him. His suit was rocked by explosions before he boosted away."Perfect a long range attack." He muttered to himself. It was clear his attackers were correcting their aim, as the explosions began to close in on his new position.  Before he could cut his loses and run, missile fire and bazooka rounds rained down on him from above.  Jarvis quickly brought his shield up, but it couldn't protect him from all of the projectiles.  
<br><br>

<br><br>
Markos smiled as his attack caught the Federation suit off guard. He urged the dodai he was riding to move as the Federation suits beam fire impacted on his goufs shield. The Feddie suit followed him as he swung around, leaving himself completely open to the sneak attack from behind. " Right on time." Markos said as the Zaku II J under his command burst through the trees a ways behind the GM Command. Without hesitating the Zaku fired it's machine gun and leg missiles towards the GM Commands unprotected backside. The Federation suit stuttered as the rounds punched into it's back, and was spun around completely as the missiles blew it's shield arm off in a hail of metal. 
<br><br>
The Apsalus I gave a gentle hum as Yuji pushed it towards the battle. "Rhett do you read me? I'm entering the combat area. Have the escort you mentioned meet up with me." Said Yuji, who didn't bother to listen for a response. A few seconds later he did notice two dopps swing in behind him.  He angled his suit down as he approached the GM Command currently getting slaughtered in the crossfire of Markos and a Zaku. "Aim for the center of the suit." radioed Yuji to the dopp pilots.  Following his own advice Yuji's head vulcans punched rounds into the GM Commands chest. As The dopp's escorting him loosed all their missiles towards the doomed suit.
<br><br>
"Damn It!" Cried Jarvis as he activated the eject system. His cockpit was hurled from the suit mere seconds before the missiles impacted. The GM Commands chest was torn wide open by the explosion. Jarvis himself was a little worse for wear. But he managed to eject early enough to survive the explosion. Thankfully his escape pod blended in with the shrapnel from his suit, and the zeon soldiers assumed he was dead. Minutes later when Jarvis felt it was safe, he activated a distress beacon. "God I hate this place." Was all he said as he began the long wait for a rescue squad.

The massive grey hull of the <i>Floppy Lion</i> dwarfed the three GM suits as they floated lifelessly in space. Earth and its moon, in the distance, were the only objects to bring some variety to the monotony of their otherwise empty backdrop as they prepared their weapons for battle. A shooting star passed in between the two celestial orbs, each participant coming to life almost as if cued by the flash of light. <br><br>

"Rose, are all systems operational?" The captain of the Salamis inquired of his second in command.  "Aye, everything is as well as can be sir, considering the damage we took in that sortie with the Zeeks just the other day..." The young female,s fingers moved gingerly around the screen in front of her as diagnostic screens flashed and disappeared just as quickly. Issac let out a sigh as he slouched in his captain,s chair; that battle had been more of an inconvenience than he had hoped.<br><br>

"She,ll manage..." The captain smiled confidently as he looked out the bridge at the three GMs as their optics lit up and started to show signs of life. "Give them a little something to wake 'em up... Aim for that prick Simmons..." Lon,Dozai twirled his finger, signaling the order to fire, his smile growing even wider.<br><br>

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center><br><br>

"Oh this is gonna be a piece of cake, hope you fellas, are ready for the ass kicking I,m about to hand you!?" A voice came out from one of the GM E,s as Marc Simmons taunted his fellow mobile suit pilots. "Why won,t you shut up already..."<br><br>

Before Cato could finish his thought his proximity sensors began blaring. The cockpits of all three GM,s began flashing red as they looked up in unison at a volley of missiles heading towards them. Before the other two could react, Emil,s GM E disappeared almost comically leaving Cato and Marc to deal with the oncoming force. <br><br>

"God damn commie basterd, are you nuts?" Cato grumbled to himself as he saw what his fellow officer had done. With out hesitating to throw the wise ass to the wolves, he cracked the GM E in the back with his shield, sending Simmons into the barrage of missiles.<br><br>

"Aw crap..." Simmons let out a sigh as he threw up his shield to absorb the blunt of the practice missiles. The mouthy pilot knew he was out of the exercise as his cockpit went dark, shaking his head and kicking back while he waited for the others to finish. "You guys got lucky y,know... As long as you understand that, we,ll be fine."<br><br>

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center><br><br>

"GM E Alpha has been tagged out sir, direct hit." Rose informed her captain. "Good, that,s what he gets for trying to tell me how to run my ship. I KNOW what I,m doing, pssh... fucking know it all."<br><br>

"Ok, keep up the momentum ladies and gents, we,re not a hundred percent, so we can,t be affording to let them have any windows of opportunity, keep those puppies firing!" He kicked his feet up on the console, knowing this exercise was not something he needed to worry too much about.<br><br>

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center><br><br>

"Gotcha!" Cato grinned as he ignited his beam saber in a blaze of pink energy. He swung out at the newer GM E, only to be met with a flash of energy, illuminating the fronts of their suits as they locked sabers. The two federation pilots tussled for several minutes, conservatively using their thrusters only to re-engage the other as they met blow for blow. <br><br>

"What the hell are they doing down there Rose?" Issac flipped his screen to the cameras near the escape pod to watch the ongoing duel between the two mobile suits. He shook his head. "Fire the damn pod... get them from underneath us, now!" He stood up as his gaze stayed trained on the monitor in front of him, waiting patiently to see the result of his order.<br><br>

Much to his surprise it worked a lot closer to how he had imagined then he thought it would have. The captain watched with a some what smug grin on his face as the escape pod collided into the two preoccupied suits. "Yahtzee!" He laughed as the GM,s were carried back in front of the Salamis before rolling off the capsule and coming to a stop.<br><br>

"Aye, did anyone get the number of that truck that just hit us?" Cato shook his head as he tried to regain his bearings. The officer finally righted his suit after untangling it from Emil,s GM E. He grinned as he armed his beam spray gun and took aim at the still confused Emil. <br><br>

"Oh bother..." Emil,s eyes widened as his suit came to a stop, facing his opponent only to see the barrel of a beam spray gun pointed at his optic sensors. Before he could move, his systems began shutting down and he was left floating in darkness. <br><br>

"Hey, Galoni!"<br><br>

"Huh?" The grizzled GM pilot looked up, quickly regretting his decision as he saw all the forward guns of the <i>Floppy Lion</i> aimed on him.<br><br>
"Bang..." The words left Issac,s mouth as his lips curled into a smile. The firing solution was all he needed at this point as he collapsed lazily back into his chair. "Well done boys... aaaaand Rose." The captain clapped his hands softly as the GM at the head of the ship powered down.<br><br> 

"Bring 'em in." Issac motioned to Rose to have the worker suits retrieve the lifeless GMs.<br><br>
