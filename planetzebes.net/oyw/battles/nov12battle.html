<br><br>
Anton was currently on a routine patrol in Europe. The cool grassy landscape passed under him as he pushed his GM Ground on. Anton for his part was scanning the country side as he went on with his patrol. After a few minutes he leaned back into his seat and rubbed his eyes. "I hate patrols like this." he mumbled to himself. But soon he gave his head a quick shake and return to scanning the distance. But unbeknown-est to him, three Zaku's were waiting in ambush a few mere miles ahead.

<br><br>
Ferusha was breathing in and out slowly as she waited in her Zaku II F. With each breath she could feel the suit coming closer. She gripped the controls tightly as the GM Ground finally came into view. "Get ready." she ordered her team. Beads of sweat formed on her brow as the feddie suit came closer. When the time was right, she would signal the attack. Her breathing began picking up as the suit came even closer. Even though she couldn't see it clearly she knew right when it was in between the other two zaku's. With out hesitation she ordered the attack/
<br><br>
Anton gave a cry of surprise as a Zaku burst from the forests on either side of him. He had zero time to react as both suits fired their bazookas. "Damn it!" he cried as the first round struck his shield and through his suit backwards. Luckily for him it threw him clear of the second round which tore into the ground. But before Anton could attempt any sort of counter attack. Three missiles tore out of the trees ahead of him and flew straight at him.
<br><br>
"What the hell!" he yelled as he brought his shield up. One missile crumpled into the GM's shield and exploded harmlessly. The second two slammed into the gm's right arm. The arm was throw clear and the force of the explosions ripped it off.  Anton backpedaled rapidly as the third Zaku burst from the trees like the others and began firing it's machine gun.  He attempted to fight back and he fired bursts from his 100mm machine gun. But under the weight of fire from the Zaku's he failed to land any hits. 
<br><br>
"God Damn it!" he yelled.With little choice as more bazooka rounds exploded around him. He reached for a flash grenade with his suits left hand and threw it. The moment it exploded he turned his suit on a dime and boosted away hard. "Damn Zeon." were his parting words.
<br><br>
By the time Ferusha's camera recovered the GM was out of sight. "Thats too bad." she said. With little else to do she motioned for her team to fall back.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Two Zeon mobile suits boosted through the area. Despite being in the middle of a hostile war zone. A pair of SAF personnel still found time to further test their machines. They drifted into a vacant area of space occupied only by debris.
<br><br>
"This looks like a good spot." said Caleb. He pulled back on the throttle of his suit and brought it to a rest. He then rotated his Prototype Gelgoog around to face his opponent. He confirmed his mmp-80 was loaded with paint rounds before signaling his ready.
<br><br>
"I agree." said Nadia. As she brought her Zaku Minovsky type to a stop,she began prepping her suit's M particle dispersion system. As the system fully came online she noticed she had a tremor in her right hand. "I'm ready." said Nadia as she clenched her fist a few times.
<br><br>
"Alright let's go!" yelled Caleb as he threw his suit forward.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
The gun jerked in the Gelgoog's hand as a burst of paint rounds tore out of the barrel.  Nadia was forced to push her suit to the side narrowly avoiding the rounds. She quickly responded with a burst of her own and began spreading particles."Let's see how well he shoots now." said Nadia. Caleb cursed as his sensors began failing and, fired rounds and managed to clip the legs of Nadia's suit. Nadia grunted lightly and pushed at her controls to swung her suit around. "Damn!' muttered Nadia.
<br><br>
Nadia pushed her suit away and fired some rounds to create some distance. Nadia realized her suit couldn't make it in a stand up fight with Caleb's. She boosted her suit further away trying to take advantage of the minovsky particles interference spreading. She worked the controls hard to evade the stray fire coming from Caleb.  However he would have none of that, as he pushed his suit harder to close the distance. With little choice Nadia pushed her suit into a desperate spin, and she brought her 120mm machine gun to bear and fired.
<br><br>
Caleb was boosting hard towards Nadia when she fired. Lacking a shield and time he brought up his suits left arm to take the brunt of the rounds. "Damn it, time to end this." said Caleb. Pushing his suits throttle as hard as he could his suit shot forward.  Caleb was pushed hard into his seat from the g forces. Grunting from it, he angled his suit down he shot under Nadia. Pulling at the controls he rotated his suit hard. and sprayed rounds from his gun into the back of her suit. Nadia's suit was rocked a rounds splashed across the suits back.  Nadia sighed to herself as her suits system announced she had lost.
<br><br>
"Well that was interesting." said Caleb as his suit floated  up to Nadia's. "You ready to head back?" he asked. "Alright." said Nadia. As they brought their suits around, Nadia noticed her hand was still shaking.
