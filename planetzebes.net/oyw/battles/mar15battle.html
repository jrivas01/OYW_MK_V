<br>
"Well, Private Mersault," Lieutenant Ackart said, shaping the words half-heartedly as he wiggled the GM Command's joystick around with one finger, "shall we begin?" Jarvis straightened up in his seat and stretched his shoulders. He currently had an air of congenial indifference about him; though he was curteous, bland disinterest was hardly veiled. 
<br><br>
"Very well, Lieutenant, we shall begin on your mark." The aquatic Guncannon pilot spoke with respect, though currently he was as detached from social concerns as Jarvis Ackart was from the whole proceeding.
<br><br>
The GM and Guncannon faced off several hundred meters apart, towering over the sparse foliage and patches of grass that littered the rocky soil of the gently rolling field. Trees grew as though they were uncomitted to the effort of creating a forest, leaving the impression of a half-finished painting of happy little trees.
<br><br>
"Go." The GM Command strafed to the side, dipping behind the crest of a rocky hill covered in millennia old ruins of rock walls.
<br><br>
Thierry watched as the lieutenant traced his course from the ditch to the hillside, slowly moving his own Mobile Suit behind a weedy copse of dead trees. 
<br><br>
"Interesting movements." Ackart raised an eyebrow as his ducked MS peered over the ridge. The Guncannon knelt behind the thicket of weeds and dead wood, easily covered from paint rounds. "I don't know whether to commend him on taking advantage of the situation or to condemn him for not treating it like real combat."
<br><br>
"Ackart, 12 degree movement. Correcting." Private Mersault waited for the GM Command to peek above the hill again, and as he waited, he calculated all of Lieutenant Ackart's movements, retargeting every time he approximated a small movement. The targeting reticle sharply jumped twice, lining itself up with the path Thierry predicted Ackart would take.
<br><br>
"That's enough of that, then." The adrenaline felt good, but Ackart was tiring of the sensation already. Wanting the practice session to be over, he made his move.
<br><br>
Mersault's eyes quickly spotted a small grey shape spiraling into the sky, probably... "Grenade." Mersault closed his eyes as the flashbang detonated, blinding his sensors for just long enough for Ackart to make his move. 
<br><br>
The GM Command dashed over the hill, aided by its thrusters, and as it approached the thicket, a low trajectory jump burned more fuel, and it soared over the blue Guncannon. Ackart pulled the trigger, splattering the blindly evading HDT as he passed, and spun around before landing so that he faced the Guncannon when he touched ground.
<br><br>
Thierry's eyes narrowed slightly and his pupils contracted in the normalizing light. The HDT raised its machine gun, only to have it knocked around in its hands as it was splattered by paint. 
<br><br>
"I believe you take the victory, Lieutenant," Thierry nodded, accepting defeat.
<br><br>
"...Not bad, Mersault." Ackart felt a sliver of happiness invade his heavy head at his victory, but it was quickly dulled and blackened. "Let's return now."

<br><br>
The sound of machinegun fire could be heard as the Ritter devision had begun mobile suit training combat excercises. The training grounds was an abandoned village off the coast of the baltic sea, and their enemy was a Z'Gok piloted by none other, Xavier Brennan. The small fishing town was being torn apart as if Godzilla was invading. The Panzergrenadiers were a resilient bunch; their armor made them survive under conditions normal soldiers would usually perish. That fact made them comparable to the cockroach.
<br><br>
As the Panzergrenadiers fired round after round into the Z'Gok, Xavier replied by destroying the buildings they were hiding in. The Ritter devision fought valiently, but there was still no sign of their leader. Xavier knew he was among them, as he picked up communications; nothing more than a phrase ordering his men what to do. 
<br><br>
"Switch to Panzerfaust rockets." Ritter ordered, and his men followed without hesitation.
<br><br>
From their holes, the Panzergrenadiers came out, firing Panzerfaust rockets filled with paint scented of spring mist. The village soon resembled pee wee's playhouse. Xavier could not use his mega particle cannons, so instead he replied with paint rockets as well.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
As the Panzergrenadiers kept Xavier distracted, Ritter arrived on his wappa, firing paint pellets at the Z'Gok's rear thrusters. Xavier turned to face him as Ritter drew ever closer. Ritter then fired a panzerfaust rocket straight into the Z'Gok's chest as he forced the Wappa between its legs. The paint got into the cockpit and all over Xavier's uniform.
<br><br>
The spar had ended with the Ritter devision suffering major losses and Xavier's Z'Gok downed, or thats how it would have played out if the battle was more than a simple training excercize. Instead the Ritter Devision's Panzergrenadier armor was less intimidating, and the Schutzstaffel's Xavier Brennan smelt of spring flowers.
<br><br>
Upon arriving back to the Lorelay, Xavier is greeted by captain Marina Nimue, smiling at his paint drenched appearence.
<br><br>
"What?" he asked.
<br><br>
"You smell pretty." she remarked jestingly.
<br><br>
He remained silent and headed towards his quarters to take a shower.

<br>
For the first time in a long time, the Earth Federal Forces are on the offensive.  Across the war torn surface of the planet Earth, the mighty Odessa Task Forces rumbled and sailed towards their prime target.  The Space Force is no different, as Wakkein had dispatched the whole Luna II Defense Fleet towards Earth Orbit.
<br><br>
Another river of lights departed from the Luna II asteroid fortress.  Seen as glimmering lights by their engine flares, the newly formed Bollocks Fleet prepared to enter the fray of battle.  But as the men and women of the EFSF sailed onwards, two smaller lights drop away from the fleet.
<br><br>
Both units spun around to a stop behind the rear vessel in the fleet formation.  A voice crackled to life over their radios.
<br><br>
"<i>Now remember</i>," said the flight director," <i> if you go past the maximum retrieval range, do not try to catch up with the fleet.  You'll run out of propellant by then.  Instead, head back to Luna II.  You'll have a better chance of living if you do... So watch your navigation systems, people.</i>"
<br><br>
"Back in my day..." muttered Officer Candidate Alex Sentara as he pulled the control stick on his Saberfish II," we'll have tanker units around that can refill us."
<br><br>
"I guess we will just have to make this quick," proclaimed Seaman Michael Kreuz as the GM Sniper II chambered a paintball round.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Streams of tracer fire marked where the paintball rounds were headed as the two experienced pilots faced off each other.  The Vulcan pod on Kreuz's GM Sniper II spat continuous fire as the frustrated sniper watch his opponent stay clear of the rounds.
<br><br>
The Saberfish II is an agile and small target.  Kruez did not expect it to be so hard for him to hit one with his sniper rifle.  But there it was, darting around like a little sparrow.  The only good he got out of the sniper rifle is the extra sensors that allowed him to track Sentana.
<br><br>
The Saberfish II pilot on the other hand is having problems of his own.  Thanks to the AMBAC system, Kruez can manuever much better in tight spaces.  So whenever Sentana strafes him with paintball rounds, all the sniper needs to do is twitch in any direction.  By the time Sentana could adjust his fire, the GM Sniper II is either counterattacking or manuevering to another position.
<br><br>
Throughout the entire match so far, both pilots had to break off as the maximum retrieval limit changed with the position of the fleet.
<br><br>
Sentana needs to do something and fast.  Suddenly an idea came to him in the form of a memory from his Tin Cod days.  Much to Kreuz's surprise, the Saberfish II banked away from him and retreated at full speed.  The GM Sniper II's Advanced Targetting Visor snaps into place as Kreuz went in pursuit.
<br><br>
The ballistic sniper rifle's action cycled over and over as Kruez tried to corner the fighter between rifle shots.  His eyes narrow as paintball after paintball narrowly misses the Saberfish II.  Then suddenly, the unexpected happen.
<br><br>
Sentana, cut back his engines and pulled up.  This manuever nearly collided the Saberfish II with the GM Sniper II as the mobile suit flew past Sentana's cockpit canopy.  Kruez whinced as he slung the sniper rifle around trying to hit the fighter.
<br><br>
But as Sentara pulled away, he fired off both his Dummy Balloon missiles.  They erupted into inflated decoys, delicate enough to pop by the high velocity paint ball rounds.  But it was enough to cover Sentana's escape.
<br><br>
For a moment, Kreuz was curious as to why his opponent had done that.  Then suddenly, klaxons rang in his cockpit.
<br><br>
<i>WARNING: LEAVING MAXIMUM RETRIEVAL LIMIT IN FIVE SECONDS</i>
<br><br>
Cursing vigorously, Kreuz flipped the GM Sniper II around and gunned his engines.  His navigation system showed the location of the Bollocks Fleet and if he wanted to catch up, Kruez will need to do a mad dash at full power for the next minute or so.
<br><br>
Then he saw the trap.  Sentana's Saberfish II came around for another attack run on the hapless GM Sniper II.  Kreuz cannot change course or return fire until he finish doing his thruster burn.
<br><br>
The blue mobile suit became a vivid shade of neon yellow as Kreuz kept his course towards the Bollocks Fleet.  After half a minute of pelleting his comrade with paintballs, Sentana closed into formation with Kreuz.  A grin is visible on Sentana's face all the way back to the Bollocks Fleet.

<br><br>
In the bay of Normandy, several Federation soldiers met up to spar amongst themselves. It was last minute preperations before the shitstorm that was Odessa. Seth Yamanu and his marines stayed close to the ground, camoflaging themselves with their surroundings as the GM Cold Climate Type and Mass Produced Guntank went at it.
<br><br>
From afar he watched the battle ensure, waiting for an opportunity to strike; an the opportunity would present itself when one of the mobile suits were eliminated from the battlefield. Seth had been surveying the battle so far, weighing both pilots weaknesses and strengths in an attempt to predict a possible winner. 
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
It was evident that the GM Cold Climate Type's pilot, Thomas Parks,  wasn't as experienced as the mass produced Gun Tank's pilot, Jack Murphy. In terms of mobile suit selection though, Thomas had the clear advantage. Not only was the GM CCT better equiped for France's landscape, but it also had the advantage of close combat as opposed to the Guntank; a purely artillery mobile suit.
<br><br>
As Thomas fired at the Guntank, he continued to miss as he was evading grenades that Jack had been firing. Thomas dashed forward, using his shield to protect himself from the rounds of machinegun fire that Jack had began to fire. As thomas kept charging, the GM now resembled an easter egg due to the paint rounds. Jack then moved forward, ramming the GM with his Howitzers. It was then determined that Thomas had lost, but there were still other players on the battlefield.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Hoorah Marines! Hoorah!" yelled Seth Yamanu, as he lead his soldiers into the mock battlefield, guns blazing.
<br><br>
In a matter of seconds they had surrounded the Guntank and fired their complete load out of weapons at the mobile suit. It was like the last level of Doom, but the enemies were a lot smaller and human. Jack did the best he could, firing paint pellets out of his hand machineguns, but he was soon overwhelmed.
