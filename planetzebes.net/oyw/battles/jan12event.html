<br>
The RF-3 mine in Central Asia had remained untouched compared to the mines in North Africa. [i]"That was until today anyway[/i] Thought Des as pulled slightly at collar of the stolen zeon uniform. Glancing to the side he saw the rest of his squad was blending in nicely. Nodding to himself he returned his sight to the front as he continued to make his way onto the base. It had been a slight trick to sneak onto base. But now that they'd done it, he had to stay focused. 
<br><br>
"The truck should be showing up soon." Des said to Sage who was slightly behind him. The scar faced freedom fighter merely nodded his head in turn.
<br><br>

<br>
Estrella wrestled the MM-1 heavy transport up to the guard house at the RF-3 mine. Her hands clenched around the wheel as the guard exited the gate house and approched the transport. "What's your business." he asked as he came up to the driver side window. "Just dropping off this Zaku Worker for a labor contract." said Estrella motioning towards the rear of the truck. "Contact? Wait here for a moment." the guard replied and quickly made his way back to the gate house. [i]So far so good.[/i] thought Estrella
<br><br>

<br>
Des saw the transport pull up to the gate house across the base right as him and blue squad reached the hangar. "Alright, lets try to keep things smooth." he whispered to his squad right as they entered the hangar. Des's plans were sadly going to fall through as him and his squad came face to face with a group of zeon marines. Des and his men froze, and time seemed to stop for all but a second before the Sargent of the marines yelled "Fire!" forcing both sides to open up on each other. 
<br><br>
"Damn, so much for the plan." yelled Des as he threw himself behind a piece of cover and returned fire. Taking the area in with a glance Des was pleased to note that nobody had gone down in the opening salvo. Just as Des was about to try to push his squad into action, a loud hum filled the hangar. Glancing briefly around his cover he saw the Adzam at the other end of the hangar coming to life. "Shit." yelled Des as he saw the prize slipping out of his hands. looking to the side he spotted Sage. "Sage, signal for red squad." Des yelled knowing he had to make the best of the situation as he could. Even though he didn't have time to look, he heard Sage fire off the signal flare.

Jocelyn lay propped on a hill a short distance away from the zeon mining base. It was from here she saw the flare shot into the sky. Throwing a side long glance to Elden who lay but a foot next to her. "Signal for Aisha to move out." she said in a single breath as she pulled out a small detenator switch. "Lets see if paying for that inside job was worth it." she muttered as depressed the button. Seconds later the base was lit up by fire as the entire air field was covered in flames. "A

<br>
Estrella ducked down in her seat as the air field exploded. Panicing Estrella's foot hit the gas hurling the heavy transort forward smashing through the small gate house before she could hit the breaks. "What the hell was that." she heard Troy ask as the Zaku Warrior dismounted from the truck before she could do anything else. "Look your parts done, pull back." Troy said and the Zaku Warrior turned and charged further onto the base. Leaving Estrella to wrestle the transport around.
<br><br>

<br>
Aisha pushed her suit forward as fast as it would go. The Type 74 trailing behind her with Bravo platoon riding on it, and her two zaku's. The type 74 was already picking up enemy mobile suits approaching and she hadn't even reached the base yet. Aisha grinded her teeth together as 3 Zaku J's appeared in the distance. Attempting to take the advantage in the engagement Aisha and her zaku's opened fire with their respective machine guns. Rounds flew towards the enemy taking the lead ms straight in its chest. It staggered for a few moments before violently. Aisha and her team had little time to celebrate though as the remaining two zakus returned fire from their machine guns. Raising her shield as she moved forward Aisha managed to avoid taking the worst of it. The Zaku trailing behind her to the right wasn't so lucky. Enemy fire smashed it's mono eye leaving the pilot blind as further fire crippled the suits legs. Aisha tried to cover her fallen comrade firing from the hip as she hurled herself towards the nearest enemy Zaku.
<br><br>

<br>
Des cursed as the last on the enemy marines fell beneath the concentrated fire of his squad. Not even five feet away from him Ozie lay on the ground. A single hole in his forehead was the only sign needed to figure out what happened. "Damn it come on." yelled Des and he pushed his squad to move on. As soon as he exited the hangar Des spooted Troy in the Zaku Worker hurling a grenade at the Adzam drifting towards it. "Support rockets." Des yelled as he pulled the rpg launcher off his back. Kneeling on the ground he let loose the rocket propelled grenade. Sending it streaking towards the hovering Adzam. Three others joined his and impacted directly into the center of the Adzam. While doing only little Damage it gave Troy a small window to throw one final grenade before twin mpc fire punched through his suits chest, ending his life in an explosion that tore his suit apart. His last grenade however impacted directly into a leg of the Adzam blowing it clear off. But Des feared only the worst as the Adzam emerged from the smoke to face him and his squad.
<br><br>

<br>
Aisha's Gm Ground crashed head long into the Zaku J in front of her. Her shield digging into the suits chest as she hurled it away from herself. Before she could move further against it though, missiles pounded into her suits back blowing her shield arm clear off and damaging her suits left leg. "Damn it!" she yelled fearing the worst until fire from the remaining zaku in her team flashed around the Zaku J attacking her. Quickly switching targets from her to the new agressor, the Zeon zaku let less its remaining leg missiles. Yelling as her friend died Aisha turned her damaged suit to face the Zaku and fired off a burst from her machine gun. Rounds punched into the Zaku J repeatedly, causing smoke to belch out before the suit merely fell backwards. 
<br><br>
"Bastards!." Yelled Aisha as she turned and fire into the Zaku J she had downed with her charge. Multiple rounds impacted into the downed Zaku's backpack prompting its torso to tar apart in a massive explosion. Glancing briefly back at the zaku incapacitated zaku on her team, and the type 74 hovering near by. "Wait here." she ordered before pushing on. She pushed her damaged suit as fast as it could go towards the base and across the still slightly burning air field. A small truck bursts through the flames nearly right in front of Aisha prompting her to fire out of sheer surprise. Her rounds impact directly in front of it forcing it to flip end over end before exploding. 
<br><br>
"What the hell." she yelled, as another explosion occurred just a short distance off. With out knowing why she moved her suit towards that area through the smoke. With less than a third of a magazine left in her gun she could feel herself grinding her teeth again.  Aisha's suit emerged from the smoke just in time to see the Adzam fire on Des's squad. Aisha didn't waste a moment and emptied the remainder of her machine gun into the Adzam. The mobile armor shuddered as rounds tore into its already weakened armor. It got off one final volley of mpc fire towards Aishas already damaged suit before internal explosions ballooned its armor out before exploding. Aisha's GM Grounds left leg was torn off completely this time and her suit was sent skidding across the torn up tarmac. Her head throbbed as her suit came to a rest. Struggling for only a brief moment to get free before the sweet darkness of unconsciousness gripped her.
<br><br>

<br>
Des felt someone slap his face as his eyes popped open. "What happened?" he managed to choke out. The world quickly fell into focus and he saw that it was Sage standing over him. "Damn Adzam nearly killed us before Aisha managed to finish it." Said Sage as he slowly helped Des up. "The other?" Des asked clutching his sides. "Don't worry you seemed to be the worst off. You should rest til somebody can take a look at your ribs though." replied Sage as he helped Des limp over to the Hangars wall to rest against.

<br>
They are an odd bunch.  Standing first in the defensive line at the entrance to South America is the Mexican Border Patrol.  This Federal force is made of veteran pilots handpicked to ride stolen Zeon Zaku II F mobile suits.  The group was born during the days of desperation for the Earth Federal Forces when Zeon first landed on the planet.  But even today they stand vigilant against Zeonic incursions towards the heart of the EFF.
<br><br>
One of the pilots ate a spoonful of chili from his ration pack.  The lush green landscape of South America is absolutely beautiful in the good weather.  The view is gorgeous from where the pilot is sitting on the edge of the open cockpit.
<br><br>
The Federal pilot finished his meal but just as he was about to take a drink from his canteen, his jaw drops. The water poured out his canteen and splashed against the side of the Zaku II F.  He drops the water bottle and fumbled for this binoculars.
<br><br>
In the distance, shapes are appearing.  The most noticeable are the giant purple specks against the white clouds.  Twisting head over heels, the pilot landed back in his cockpit and grabbed his headset.
<br><br>
"SARGE!" cried the Federal pilot," We got Zeeks coming in fast!"
<br><br>
Down below, the Sergeant was already standing next to the parked Type 74.  He bursted inside the cabin, his question answered before he even asked.
<br><br>
"Heavy transient noises!"
<br><br>
"Seismic readings are moving off the chart!"
<br><br>
That was all the Sergeant needed to hear.  "Contact to command pronto!  I'm going to get these suits moving!"
<br><br>
It was then that they heard the sound of approaching jet engines.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
On the bridge of the Dobday-class <i>Schmerz</i>, the Zeon captain turned towards his communications officer.  The 9th Combined Operations Fleet is making a daring and bold move into the heart of Earth Federal territory and the captain is more than honored to bear the responsibility.
<br><br>
"Feds transmitting, Feds transmitting!" cried out the communications officer.  The captain hurried to his side.  Next to him is the flight command officer.
<br><br>
"Captain, sensors report Federal patrol unit range four kilometers and closing sir," reported the comm officer," the Luggun picked up their transmission."
<br><br>
"How many kilometers?" asked the flight command officer as the captain reached for his command microphone.
<br><br>
"Four kilometers and closing sir!"
<br><br>
The captain looked at the flight command officer.  "We got to destory that unit before they give away our position." He turned back towards his command microphone.  "Call the Dopps in on them!  Sound general quarters!"
<br><br>
As the klaxons and intercom announcements began, the flight command officer is already shouting commands to his own subordinates.  
<br><br>"Mobile suit pilots man your suits!  All crews to their units!"
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
In a command bunker somewhere in Earth Federal controlled South America, a high ranking officer bursted through the doors of a command center.
<br><br>
"Status report!" he barked loud enough for everyone to jump.
<br><br>
"Sir, we have a partial transmission from the Mexican Border Patrol warning about Zeon movements in our region."
<br><br>
"Do we have confirmation or Dish aircraft in the region?"
<br><br>
"No sir, we don't."
<br><br>
"Then people, we have a <u>problem</u>.  Where is the nearest Dish aircraft?"
<br><br>
"Dish aircraft will be on station in 30 seconds."
<br><br>
"Put it on the main screen."
<br><br>
Miles away, the Dish aircraft from the 198th Fighter Division edged closer to where the last transmission of the Mexican Border Patrol was.  A camera on the underbelly of the Federal aircraft zoomed in to show a horrifying image.  A heatsword stuck out of the chest of a EF Zaku II F, as the monoeye of Duncan Keystone's Gouf glares at the direction of the Dish aircraft.
<br><br>
Back at the command bunker, the high ranking officer muttered," Oh my god, it's a trick..."
<br><br>
He turned towards the rest of the command staff.  "Commence Operation FIREWALL, call in those tanks-."
<br><br>
"This is Warhorse, roll in strike package Delta-."
<br><br>
"151st Division, begin your attack."
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
As the two Gaws, Dobday, and Gallop of the 9th Combined Operations Fleet moved past the still burning remains of the four Zaku II Fs of the Mexican Border Patrol, enormous tank threads crushed the burning chasis of the Type-74.  Bryce Hollerfelt, spy turned pilot, pushed the controls forward as the main cannon of the Hidolfr sought more targets.  Around him, Magella attack tanks drove in formation.
<br><br>
Above the Zeon armor, dozens of Dopps surge forward.  They are followed by the Alain Grace and Rhett Paruta on their Dodais.  The Efreet Custom and Paruta's MS Team make easy workings of the 151st Fighter Division.  The combination of superior Dopp numbers and flying mobile suits made the Tin Cod's mission a suicidal one.  To their credit, one of the Tin Cods managed to let loose his missiles at the <i>Dragon</i> before being wiped out of existence.
<br><br>
On the ground, the lead elements of the 9th Combined Operations Fleet encounter more desperate resistance.  The tanks of the 183rd Armored Division had laid hidden in the trees until the Zeon mobile suits are upon them.
<br><br>
Ferusha Glavadeen forced her Zaku II F to take a step back just as a round from a Type-61 flew by her Zaku's head.  The newtype is soon joined by a fellow gifted pilot as Persephone Dawn joined blasted the line of dug-in tanks with 120mm fire.  The South American dirt took much of the punishment however as the Type-61s continue to fire under the onslaught.
<br><br>
Then came a succession of explosions.  Like a pack of cheetahs, Marko Dresner and Noelle Everett flew across the landscape on their thermonuclear hoverjets.  The Dowadge and Dom unleashed the explosive fury of their Giant Bazookas, severely remodelling the landscape into the 183rd Armored Division's graveyard.
<br><br>
Suddenly, all attention turned westward.  The final Federal pariticpant came charging in at that moment.  The Fly Mantas of the 198th Fighter Division flew past flak and missiles as they dove for the Gallop-class <i>Liger</i>.  One by one their numbers dwindled until the last aircraft got close enough to the <i>Liger</i> to ensure that his missiles will hit.
<br><br>
But as the missiles left the Fly Manta's hardpoints, the sound of threads and gears roared loudly.  Like a sports car doing a trick up the ramp, the shadow of the Hidolfr launched into the air.  Hollerfelt had saw the plane's attack run, gunned his engines, and ran off an incline in the ground.
<br><br>
The Fly Mant's missiles explode against the thick armor of the Hidolfr, banging Hollerfelt around inside the cockpit.  The body of the half-tank, half-MS struck the side of the Gallop and stopped.  The Fly Manta met a much worse fate.
<br><br>
As the 9th Combined Operations Fleet regrouped, they left behind the burning funeral fires of three whole Federal units.  A dark omen as the sun begins to set.
