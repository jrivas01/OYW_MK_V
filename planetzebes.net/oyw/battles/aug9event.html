<br>
Side 2, the location in the Earth Sphere that has called itself home to numerous of the Zeon Expeditionary Forces space mines known as Overlords. Through out the course of the war, many have been built, and many have faced the guns of the Earth Federation.
<br>
The Federation Salamis Kai-class warship <i>Ogre</i> went about its task, the ship's captain sipping tea from a fine china cup. A sure sign of the decadence within the Earth Federation, but those within it would simply view it as a sign of their ability to maintain civility even in combat. The helmsman of the <i>Ogre</i> turned to face the captain.
<br>
"Sir! We've approached the target, do we proceed?" Even though the answer was obvious, protocols were protocols, what with rumors of what Commodore Creed would do if there was even one breach of conduct. The captain nodded, and the fore MPCs of the <i>Ogre</i> bristled to life, fore rocket launchers also launching their deadly payloads into the asteroid mine.
<br>
The marines and crew inside the mine felt every impact of mega particle and rocket, the asteroid itself seemingly coming apart at the seams with every volley. They knew there was no chance for mercy, seeing what had happened to Purgatorio and Texas Colony. This new Federation commander was a breed apart, and it was a sign of the times. More and more, their enemies were becoming like Basque Ohm and Jamitov Hymen, bent on their complete and utter annihilation. No mercy, no quarter given. Their lives had been sealed the moment the <i>Ogre</i> had opened fire.
<br>
The entire operation had taken a little under an hour, until the Salamis found itself floating alone in space, the asteroid mining facility once known as <i>Overlord 10</i> was left as nothing more than rubble.

<br>
For all of the fighting done in the across the Earth Sphere, one only needs to step foot on the ground above Jaburo to see how diverse this war is.  Wreckage from every type of terrain dotted the butchered landscape.  Even the burning wreckage from space warships protrude above what little vegetation is left.  Pockets of intense radiation litter the area, fallout from the Zeon's desperate use of nuclear warheads.
<br><br>
But throughout it all, the headquarters of the Earth Federation stood firm.  Now, from factories kept hidden from Zeon eyes, Jaburo had emptied itself of the fruit of its labor.  Spaceships rocketed into space and a ground fleet had already departed.
<br><br>
The last task for the Jaburo garrison is to break the siege strangling the base by the Schutzstaffel Tactical Fighting Unit.  They have no idea that the job is already done for them.
<br><br>

<br>
Lieutenant Alec Irusk clenched his teeth as the joints on his Z'Gok E groan in protest.  
<br><br>
"Well, raise the <i>Pendragon</i> again!" he ordered the radio operator," they couldn't have just disappeared without us knowing about it."
<br><br>
The Warmonger knew something was wrong when he couldn't raise the three submarines of the Zeon fleet.  The damaged amphibious suit looked around to survey what was left of the fleet he lead into South America.  They took a pounding in their gambit to raid Jaburo once more.  While they took much satisfaction in the destruction they cause, the Federal base still stands.
<br><br>
Off the coast, the Mad Angler-class <i>Pendragon</i> continues to ignore the calls of the supposed commander of the STFU.  Behind Marina is Raven Tarasova, whose written orders are clear if not odd.
<br><br>
"Maintain silent running," confirms Marina with a glance at her SS superior," we have our own job to do."
<br><br>
Up and down the ranks of the Zeon fleet, what was once a highly disciplined Zeon force is becoming unglued.  Different units began to act on one set of orders contrary to others while finding themselves facing conflicting circumstances.  The end result is a drastic increase in radio communications throughout the battline.
<br><br>
Such a commotion cannot be kept hidden this close to a Federal stronghold.  Seizing on the opportunity, the top brass at Jaburo sent out a call for all available units nearby.  They are to attack the Zeon force while it is still disorganized and vulnerable to attack.
<br><br>
Private Gai Kaiser and Captain Tony Knight were the first to sense something was wrong as the Jet Core Boosters of the 133rd Airborne strafe their position.  The Gallop Assault-class <i>Arthur</i> open up with what AA fire it had as the Gaw-class <i>Raven</i> went to full power as it tried to get close to provide air support.
<br><br>
But as individual members of the STFU began firing into the air, something on the ground breathed fire at their feet.
<br><br>
Corporal Gilgamos Uruk gave a yelp as his Zock leans to one side.  The massive mobile suit's right foot sank into the mud as the Type 61s of the 85th Armored shot into his right ankle.
<br><br>
The scene repeated itself everywhere.  Even in the rivers that led out into the Atlantic Ocean, Zeon mobile weapons are ambushed by Don Escargots of the 99th Airborne.  On the bridge of the <i>Pendragon</i>, Marina frowned at the sighting of ASW craft this far from Jaburo's hangars.  It's only a matter of time before they detect the damaged Zeon submarines.
<br><br>
Things got worse when doors to the Jaburo base open up and veteran GM units emerged.  Now being attacked from above, below, and in front of them with zero coordination, the Zeon force crumbles.
<br><br>
Friendly fire ended up doing just as much damage as enemy attacks.  The safest place is the water and those who could, took to the ocean.  Those who are left on the ground became the focus of the Federal retribution.  Tony Knight fired shot after shot from his Gelgoog's beam rifle only to be cut to shreds from every direction.  Some of the fire that punctured his suit is Zeon.  As the Gelgoog S came to rest on the ground, Knight kicked open the hatch.
<br><br>
Suddenly above him, the Gaw-class <i>Raven</i> saw its last breath as the Jet Coreboosters of the 133rd Airborne tore it apart like falcons on a turkey.  The TAF officer made a run for it before the dying purple aircraft crashed onto the abandoned Gelgoog.  It wouldn't be until after dusk that Knight would limp away from his hiding spot.
<br><br>
Even though the Federal units were making great strides, those Zeon soldiers who could coordinate their actions fought back with great tenacity.
<br><br>
Irusk kicked away a final GM before he drags a (blessingly) quiet Gai Kaiser and his Galbady Alpha away from the battlefield.  Under the waves, Gil Krundel had finally beaten back the Don Escargots that hounded the STFU submarines.  The Zock waddled off, kicking aside the remains of the tanks that startled Uruk before.
<br><br>
As what was once the STFU disappear in all directions, the Gallop Assault-class <i>Arthur</i> exploded as its massive missile system detonated.  The damage was too much and its death marked the rear of the departing Zeon force.
