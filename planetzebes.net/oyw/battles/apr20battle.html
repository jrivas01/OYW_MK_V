In Side 4, the Prince of Aargau a Modified Cargo Transport Craft under ownership of Zeon?s Veronica Wu, descends on the once operational Overlord 5. The ruins of the Asteroid Mine was currently under control of the Federation, but for how long? Obvious foreshadowing would tell, as the Prince?s small force of two GMs prepared for launch.

As the ship entered the center of the remnants of the once glorious mine, it was made evident that the Federation had no intent of keeping the installment, let alone fortifying it. The crew aboard the bride scanned their surroundings. The two GMs launched, and scattered, scouring the location for any sort of resistance, which was not found.

Zeon reclaimed its dump and there was much rejoicing. Back in Federation HQ, a high ranking officer was informed, and he shook it off. Meanwhile back in Side 3, the victory was made to look like a great accomplishment with Zeon forces (using Federation weapons) were being made to look like heroes after enduring a largely exaggerated battle. The propaganda was printed on all major colony newspapers as a means to keep the masses distracted from their loss of all the resources they mined on Earth, during Odessa.
