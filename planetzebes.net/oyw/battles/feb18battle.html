The Black Rock Pirate Fleet attempts a second time to traverse through space to their destination, and all ships begin to thrust forward. The Ol' Jove's Bones moves on a head to make sure the path is clear. The fleets movement is synchronous in nature, as it follows the leading transport ship.
<br><br>
The Ol' Jove's Bones is suddenly struck by a portion of space debris.Hardly left a dent, but that was just the start of course. Earth was very like Earth in this instance. On Earth if you are driving down the road and a deer jumps up infront of you, you usually are gonna wait till its clear before you continue to accelerate.

<br>
Now there are many differences, among them; Meteorites and space debris, usually from ship and mobile suit wreckage, can get pretty fucking large. There was also the debris from abandoned or destroyed colony contruction, and those were the worst. ANother difference is that is the stuff comes from nowhere, and travels at immense speeds, unless caught in orbit of one of the Legrange points or a planet. Regardless, based on the size and speed of the space rocks, they will do some damage to your ship, mobile suit, or whatever.
<br><br>
The final important difference is that when your Honda Civic gets trashed by roadkill, its easily repairable because Civics are cheap pieces of crap. Now a ship on the other hand, will cost several hundred thousands to millions to replace let alone repair. Ceasing actions to repair in space was also never a good idea when it could be avoided.
<br><br>
Soon a clutter of debris were on collision to collide with the Ol' Jove's Bones. The captain reacted almost instantly, fortunately for his ship. Yet due to his underlings' reaction times not being as good as his, the ship didn't make it out completely unharmed. A wing from a saberfish dented the front of the ship, as it reveresed thrusters to get out of the cluster. It was in good time too, as a large fuel tank from a early space shuttle would of slammed right into the bridge had the captain not acted.

"We could wait till its over, but we have no idea when that will be, or we could start clearing it our with mobile suits. No matter what this will delay our advancement."

"Revvin up your engines"
<br><br>
"Listen to her howlin' roar~"
<br><br>
"Metal under tension"
<br><br>
"Beggin you to touch and go~"
<br><br>

"Turn that shit off, and shut up already... I've had to listen to your tone deaf ass all trip." The driver turned to his partner as the African Union transport sped across the ruins of Manila, a once proud city reduced to rubble. 
<br><br>
"Wha- uh... what is that?" The inspiring singer pointed out the front window as the ruined urban area gave way to an oddly placed forest. They looked around in confusion as all of a sudden they were driving through a dense forest; Tree's sped by, a mysterious path already cut in front of them. 
<br><br>
"There are forests in Manila?" 
<br><br>
"Ummm, I guess... so?" The driver shrugged
<br><br>
"Hmmm, that's crazy."
<br><br>
"Indeed... look! I see the base!" He pointed to the clearing ahead. Inside the forest was another set of ruins where the Duchy's Manila base had once stood. The truck broke the treeline, the drivers shielding their eyes as the sun beat down on the truck.
<br><br>
"There she is Kenny." They brought the truck to a screeching hault, a smoke cloud engulfed the truck as it braked. Once the smoke settled the two got out, scouted the area, and marked it up as another defenseless base captured by the African Union; they were on a roll.
