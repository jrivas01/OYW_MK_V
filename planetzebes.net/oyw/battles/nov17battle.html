Jane was hunting and her targets were close. A sandstorm had spontaneously swirled up in the late afternoon, blanketing the land with a sea of fine particulate matter. Above the dust cloud it was bright and clear. A lone Luggon patroled, watching for enemies and seeing none. Jane used the provided cover well. Fortunately, her thermal sensors worked perfectly in the dust storm. She was dug into a small pit just ahead of the Zaku's predicted line of travel.
<br><br>
"450meters, closing." she said quietly.
<br><br>
Jane toggled a switch on her right side, triggering micro corrections for windage and lead. She had her bazooka leveled on the edge of the pit waiting. The two Zaku's emerged from the relative cover they had been afforded by the sand. Their mission was complete and Private First Class Till was leading leading his troop back to have maintenance done.
<br><br>
"God forsaken sand, I wish we could go somewhere green." Ernest grumbled. "This place is a nightmare..."
<br><br>
Jane waited, patiently, breathing slowly to calm her nerves. At once a a shadow crossed Janes viewfinder, "There you are." Jane noted at the Luggon high above. The pilot crossed the sun and silhouetted himself to her, a rookie mistake. "Perfect, all the pieces are in place." she said smiling a little. The situation was textbook, the pair of enemies were oblivious and she had them dead to rights. Steeling her nerves, Jane took the shot. The first round from her bazooka ripped out of the prepared position, and screamed into its target. An up armored Zaku J, painted half green and half tan- pitched forward, its lower right leg completely blown away.
<br><br>
"CONTACT!" Ernest yelled over his throat mic at his Luggon overhead.
<br><br>
"Sir, we have nothing on the scopes!" the Luggon pilot yelled back.
<br><br>
"This is garbage, I can't see anything!" Back-pedaling, Ernest leveled his machine gun into the dust ahead and poured out suppressing fire. Jane threw aside the bazooka and leapt from the earthen pit at the enemy Zaku. Tracers ripped by her flying GM, some scoring hits on the armor but doing no real damage damage. Jane landed hard, skidding across the sand only 20 meters from the Zaku. She unslung her machine gun and leveled the weapon on her hip. She opened fire, pouring rounds into the direction of Ernies Zaku. Within seconds she had expended her magazine, dropped her first and slammed another into the weapon. Ernie fell back into the haze, his mobile suit peppered with holes, virtually disabled and unable to return effective fire. Jane, satisfied with the carnage fell back to her position, mission accomplished.

"Shit!" Issa huffed as he pulled up his shield and beam saber to block the two GM-E's as they engaged him with their own beam sabers. The fronts of their suits illuminated a bright pink as the weapons clashed, all three sets of eyes flashed green as they strained to gain advantage on the other suits. After a few moments of exchanging blows, Issa cracked Emil's GM-E in the chest with his shield, sending him spinning back. Marc tried to take advantage and score a hit, but his beam saber was met abruptly with the Gundam's beam saber in a brilliant flash. 
<br><br>
"Damnit man! Why isnâ€™t this working?" Marc was certain his tactics were going to work against the Federation's prototype suit, but so far he and his fellow GM-E pilot Emil weren't getting anywhere.  The GM-E pilot slammed his foot into the Gundam's chest and kicked off, bringing his suit to stop next to Emil's. "I think we need to reassess your tactics, smart ass..." Emil grumbled.

<br><br>
A bright explosion of light separated the two as one of Cato's flash grenades went off in between the GM and the GM Juggler. Rachel rubbed her eyes, groaning as her screens went white, temporarily blinding her. The newtype gasped as she jerked her suit to the side as a tingle faded across the back of her mind, she felt the attack, but was not fast enough to dodge it; she lost one of the bits to a beam spraygun shot. "Damn, missed ya..." Cato grumbled to himself as he strafed around til he was face to face with Rachel's suit again.
<br><br>
"Oh shit... maybe I hit her a little harder than I had intended." Cato's eyes narrowed as he looked at the lifeless GM that floated before him. 
<br><br>
Inside the cockpit of the GM Juggler Rachel held her head as the headache worsened, but she continued to concentrate on her task. With each grunt and strain she got a little bit closer to where she wanted to be. "A..almost..." She pictured the attack in her mind and before he could react Cato's cockpit shook as he took a direct hit from behind. 
<br><br>
"Shit!" He slammed his fist on his console as his power shut down. The officer had gotten caught up and not realized that both bits were missing and had paid for it. 
<br><br>
"My head..." Rachel passed out from the severe headache, collapsing in her cockpit. As she lost consciousness, the newtype left the GM and its remaining bit floating aimlessly in the void of space. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
"Can't we just call this a draw?" Issa sighed as the two GM-E's split and tried to flank the Gundam pilot. He would never admit it, but even though the Gundam was a powerful prototype, he was still having a rather frustrating time fighting these two at once. Not wasting a moment, he hurtled his shield into the head of Emil's GM-E as he charged from in front of him, crushing his optical sensors, and taking the head off. 
<br><br> 
"Gotcha!" Marc landed a hit into the Gundam's left shoulder. The GM-E pilot gloated as he went to attack again he got met with a beam saber humming just inches from his suit's head. The pilot let out a huge sigh as his beam saber faded. "Ok... you win. Whoopdee doo."
