<br>
North America, southern quadrent, a lone truck was driving along minding its own business, that is until Zeon decides to intercept it. Zeonic pilot Gilgamos Urik was traveling along with the pair of marines that were assigned to him. Gilgamos didn't really care for the marines that were with him. They tried to give him all these orders and were constantly yelling at him about the things he does, like piloting his Zgok pantsless.

<br>
“WILL YOU PUT SOME GODDAMN PANTS ON FOR FUCKS SAKE!” The Marine commander yelled over the comm.
<br><br>
“THIS IS MY GOD DAMN MOBILE SUIT! I GET MONEY TAKEN OUT OF MY DAMN PAYCHECKS TO PAY OFF THIS DAMN THING! SO THAT MEANS I GET TO RIDE IN MY OWN DAMJN COCKPIT THE WAY I WANT TO. SO SHUT THE FUCK UP. I'M DRIVING THIS THING BUCK NAKED NOW!” Gilgamos yelled back at the Marine commander, as he was stripping, letting everything hang loose.

<br>
As the two Zeon soldiers are yelling at each other the radar picks up an on coming object heading towards him. He put his comm on mute to deal with the object. He magnifies the image from his MS's cameras and see its a truck. He decides that this will be easy and simple.

<br>
Gilgamos fires a missile in the far left of the truck. The truck scretched to a halt. The Zgok aimed his arm at the truck and the driver waived a white flag and ran away.
