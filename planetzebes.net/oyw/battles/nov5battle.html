Three men floated through space with nothing but a normal suit to protect them from the harsh cold. "Why'd I have to come? I could be working on our income figures instead of freezing to death." complained Radcliffe. "Stop yer complain' before I give ye sometin to complain about." replied Sayer. "Both of ye shut yer mouths." Yelled the Cap'n. "And quit yer blubberin Radcliffe. Yer'll be back to yer numbers soon enough." putting his crews griping aside, Samuel looked at the beacon.  There had still be no reply but he supposed the ship could be behind schedule. 
<br><br>
"I'm pickin up a distress signal Captain." was the alert that shot over the bridge of the Callisto Trader. "What does it say?" asked Captain Francis. The comm's man looked back and said "Mining accident Captain. Three men stranded in just normal suits." Francis considered this for a moment. "We can't very well leave them. Helm change course, best speed to the beacon." With that Francis reclined his girth into his chair. "This is gonna put us off schedule." he muttered to himself. "Helmsman how long?" He called out. "About twenty minutes captain." replied the helmsman. Francis nodded to himself. "Lets hope it's men were pickin up and not corpses then." he said to know one in particular.

Samuel grabbed the beacon as it began to let out a new beep. "Alright lads, get yer selves ready. They be comin'." He said with a grin. He hands the beacon to Radcliffe and confirms their gear bag looks alright. "Remember Radcliffe our weapons be in here so keep it with you." said Samuel. Radcliffe nodded, "Now I want ye both to just follow my lead and don't say anythin that might give us away. Just like we planned." Samuel told them. 
<br><br>
 Minutes later they saw the ship glide into the area. A small rescue skiff was launched to carry the crew aboard.As the skiff pulled up next to him Samuel hauled himself inside doing his best to appear the part. "Thank ye sir, I thought we were goners." he told the skiff pilot. "No problem just get the rest of your team on board." said the pilot. Samuel nodded and helped Sayer and Radcliffe inside. As soon as the hatch on the skiff closed the pilot turned it around and headed back. As soon as the skiff touched down Samuel and the others wasted no time in removing the normal suits. "I never want wear one of these again." said Radcliffe with a look of disgust on his face. "For once I agree with ya." said Sayer. Samuel gave a quick nod as he looked to the skiff pilot. "I be wishin to meet your cap'n to thank him for this kind act, if that be alright." Samuel said. The pilot nodded and gestured for them to follow.
<br><br>
Samuel took careful note of the lay out of the ship as they were escorted to the bridge. The ship had a lot of hallways but not nearly enough people to cover them all. He was happy to note their were only a few soldiers as well. As the Wraith and his two crewmen arrived at the bridge, the captains chair swung around revealing a rather endowed captain. "Welcome aboard the Callisto Trader boys. I'm Captain Francis" He said with a smile before beckoning Samuel closer. Samuel approach the captain while Sayer did his best to appear Harmless, and Radcliffe sat their gear bag down and looked exhausted."Rough bit of luck these accidents are." said Francis as Samuel came up beside him "Your lucky we were in the area, anyway whats your home port?" asked Francis. "The old DarkStar mine." Samuel replied.  Francis laugh's "Old DarkStar eh? Don't you worry we'll have you home in no time." He assured Samuel. "I really be appreciaten yer help Francis." Samuel told him to which Francis waved off his thanks. "No need to thank me. Being this far out we have to watch out for each other." Francis replied. Samuel nodded. "You really do." he said in agreement.
<br><br> 
The Callisto Trader glided into view of the old Darkstar one mine. Being an old mine darkstar wasn't as modern looking as some might be these days. To be honest i looked rather rough with unatural shapes to it. "It's been a long time since I last visited. But I've made port here once or twice." Francis told Samuel.  "Yeah it be just like home to me." replied Samuel. "Comms request permission to dock and let'm no we found a few of their miners." Ordered Francis. The comm officer complied and in minutes they were gliding into the dock. 
<br><br>
As the Callisto settled into the dock Francis noticed the distinct lack of anyone around. Not only that but the dock seemed much to dark."This doesn't seem right. Where is everyone and why is it so dark?" Ask Francis. Samuel gave a slight shake of his head and attempted to look perplexed to the state of the dock. "Sir I'm detecting breaches in the ship!" came the yell from the bridge. "Damn, pirates must have seized the station. Order all hands to combat stations." Yelled Francis."Did you say pirates?" asked Radcliffe in a panic. Sayer gave him a light slap to the shoulder. "Ye better hold it together man." he said doing his part to play into the scene. Francis's next orders died in his throat as he heard gun fire ring. out. He swirled his chair around to look at the bridge door. Both Radcliffe and Sayer rushed further into the bridge to get away from the door."Don't you boys worry, our marines will take care of this scum." Said Francis. While he and the bridge crews eyes were on the door. Radcliffe passed their hidden weapons to Samuel and Sayer. Quickly taking down the bridge crew was simple for such men as them. And as Francis swung his chair back around he found a 12 gauge in his face. "I'm afraid ye be wrong about that." said Samuel. Francis saw his bridge crew on the floor either unconscious or in pain. "Now I be a reasonable fella. So what say ye order your men to stand down and we treat ya kindly. Of course there's the alternative as well." said Samuel. Francis stuttered for a moment as he heard gunfire getting closer to the bridge. He thought he even heard some screaming below the sounds of fire. "I understand." Was all he could muster out as he surrendered.
