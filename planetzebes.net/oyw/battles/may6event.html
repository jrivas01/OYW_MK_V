Morale is high on the Schutzstaffel Tactical Fighting Unit.  Like a pack of wolves fat from a successful hunt, the Jukon IIs relish their recent triumph over the EFGF 2nd Naval Convoy.  Pride and a sense of invincibility is shared by the crews of the three submarines despite the recent Federal offensive.
<br><br>
They know how to hurt the Federation and very few who can get into their way.

<br>
But the EFGF will nevertheless try their hardest.
<br><br>
Like most vessels, the ships of the EFGF 2nd Navy Convoy had automated distress beacons.  These autonomous units broadcasted 'mayday' messages on an emergency channel.  Due to Minovsky Particle interference, it took longer than usual for the EFGF to receive the signals.
<br><br>
So when the STFU made their way into the East Asia region, only the Don Escargots of the Goa National Guard was in position to interecept them.  The <i>U-77 Lorelay</i> led the column of submarines and on her bridge, Marina Eimue recieved a printed report from her sonar section.
<br><br>
"We have aircraft inbound," said her second-in-command," audio identification estimates half a dozen Don Escargots."
<br><br>
"Looks like you're keeping quite busy my dear," remarks Hans Bond as he appears on the bridge with a cup of coffee.
<br><br>
Marina handed the printout back to her officer.  "No use delaying for small targets.  Have the <i>U-53</i> and <i>U-18</i> go deep and continue on course.  We will give them covering fire.  All hands to battlestations! Deploy the mobile suits!"

<br>
The first four sonar buoys were just formalities.  The Don Escargot crews already registered what has to be a Zeon submarine on their equipment.  Not too long after the sonar buoys began pinging, depth charges and torpedoes dropped into the water.
<br><br>
The <i>Lorelay</i> manuevered itself around the ASW attacks, her season crew playing the ship like a well-tuned instrument of war.  The underwater explosions shook the ship but very little damage compounded on the battle scarred vessel.
<br><br>
The Don Escargots were going to do another pass when three figures popped out of the water.  A Z'Gok and two Goggs unleashed a surprise barrage, which downed two Don Escargots and caused the others to fled.
<br><br>
By the time the Goa National Guard went back on the attack, the Jukon IIs of the Schutzstaffel Tactical Fighting Unit are below the thermal layer.  This segment of the ocean depth is where the warm water of the surface meets the cold water of the ocean floor.  The temperature and water density differences lowers sonar performance.  It would take four hours until the Goa National Guard confirm their failure in stopping the marauding Zeon fleet.
