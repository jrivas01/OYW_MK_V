<br>
<i>Laura...
<br><br>
Emeline...
<br><br>
D.D... </i>
<br><br>
It was for those left behind that he was stronger; everyone around him seemed to perish, but still he stood. To him, Emil, he couldn't die, through out the war, everyone he ever got close to died, yet he seemed immune to the dangers of battle.
<br><br>
"I will take the Federation down if I have to do it alone..."
<br><br
Emil was convinced he could wade through the burning wreckage of the battle field, and take the Federation's war machine on solo; after all, he was invincible...
<br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
A shadow seemed to float effortlessly through out the halls of the STS-45, seeming to avoid any light. The Schutzstaffel Operative ducked into a doorway as he heard a pair of pilots walking down the hall. Gihren's spy wanted to leave them lifeless on the cold steel floor, but he had recieved his orders; there was no need for any unnecessary attention.
<br><br>
Once they had distanced themselves from the "Black Leader" he continued his way to his objective.
<br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Sir, we're picking up..." The Agincourt's radar tech paused for a second as he looked at his screen, his eyes widening as the reality of the situation began to set in. "SIR! missiles incoming, it would appear the Autonomous Duchy fleet is moving on us, Tianem Sir!"
<br><br>
The commander looked as his comm officer pulled the visuals off the missiles up on the main screen; As much as he hated to admit it, he had heard news of the losses handed to the Federation fleets at the hand of the Expedtionary Fleet; it would seem a tactical retreat was best...
<br><br>
"Commence evasive maneuvers, sound tactical retreat, we are to rendezvous with Ohm."
<br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Retreat? Hmmm..." A strange Federation soldier muttered to himself at the back of the bridge of the Columbus class STS-45. He raised an eyebrow at the unexpected order. "Oh well, guess this just means I have to accelerate my schedule."
<br><br>
The soldier raised two silenced pistols, and began executing the bridge crew, bodies dropping two at a time as the flashes from the muzzle illuminated the ill lit room with each pull of the trigger. 
<br><br>
"We've been boarded! Enemy has infiltrated! Help!" A Comm tech began to radio for help as a bullet was placed in the back of his head. As his limp body slid off the radio panel, his weight pressed the alarm button. Within seconds the lights went out, giving way to dull red lights, klaxons blaring to warn of the intrusion.
<br><br>
"Shit!" The SS Operative could see armed guards on the security cameras, rushing to his location. Trying to think quickly, Black Leader moved to jam the door to the bridge. He could hear banging as they slammed the butts of their rifles against the door to try and break it open. 
<br><br>
Admist all the chaos, the Columbus' fighter compliment scattered, taking off to escort the fleet, and to flee the compromised carrier.
<br><br>
"Fire on the Colombus! The carrier has been taken over, we can't risk letting it survive, all cannons give me a firing solution!" Tianem gave the order to shoot down the STS-45, and in a blink a collection of beams and missiles collided with the lifeless carrier, sending it up in a violent explosion; Black Leader never had a chance to get off.
<br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Sir impact in 10 seconds, we can't avoid the barrage." Tianem grunted as he realized he ran into a trap. "Brace for impact!"
<br><br>
As the missiles roared towards the Federation fleet, a few shapes seemed to flit back and forth between the cluster. Hiding in the radar shadows of the artillery, Florian carefully guided his bits pulling them back at the last minute as the missiles slammed into the sides of the Colombus class STS-39, destroying it on impact; a few more rounds peppered the sides of the other ships, the Warspite, and Mulin taking the majority of the damage.
<br><br>
In the wake of the chaos, a lone red mobile armor sped into the battle field, the bits forming around the Val Varo, almost as if orbiting the massive war machine. Felix's sights were set on the damaged warspite, like a shark after blood in the water, he moved to engage. GM's and Balls alike tried to fend off the mobile armor, but Florian skillfully used the bits to disable the suits, Felix snatching the occasional ball that wandered too close, and crushing it in the val Varo's claws. 
<br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The pressure was always the strongest on the battle field, almost overwhelming at times, but Florian had grown accustomed to it by now. He could almost separate the feelings of his fellow pilots from those of the enemies, their pressure he had become familiar with over these times of war. 
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
Florian's concentration was broken as something seemed to tickle the back of his mind, something was wrong... He looked to his left and his right to see the Rick Dom II and the Act zaku, but they didn't budge; the two escorts held their ground as they stood ever vigilante, guarding their "sniper".
<br><br>
<i>I know this feeling...</i>
<br><br> 
The young newtype scanned the battle field to see a Rick Dom II running off to engage the Nashville. It was Emil, but something was different...
<br>
<center><font color"3300ff" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"What is he doing?!" Lady Wu exclaimed as it was brought to her attention that Myberg was going off solo to take on one of the ships; that idiot. "Send him reinforcements, now!"
<br><br>
Richard Banks sighed as he listened to the Fleet commander bark orders, he couldn't believe that Emil would do this; He didn't think he was serious. The SAF Officer closed the cockpit to his Rick Dom II and took off, followed by a small force of zaku kai's to provide the necessary back up to Myberg.
<br>
<center><font color="3300ff" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Felix realized after flying solo for a few minutes that the Bits had fallen away. "I wonder what happened to Cuyler..." 
<br><br>
Dismissing it and not wanting to be caught by surprise, the Val Varo banked to the right, spinning as it came around to the rear end of the Warspite, opening fire with his main cannon, the beam of energy pierced through the ship, causing it to explode. The resulting explosion breached the hull of the already damaged STS-39, causing it to implode on itself as well. 
<br><br>
With out saying a word, he turned his sights to the remaining ships that were trying to escape at the other end of the battle field. "Oh no you don't..."
<br>
<center><font color="3300ff" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
On the outskirts of the battle field, Junichi Ghettid watched quietly as his black zaku kai sat lifelessly on the bow of the Veiled Intent. Reports had gotten back to him of Black Leader's failure and the SS soldier was not pleased. From his post it seemed as if the MAF and SAF teams had everything under control. 
<br><br>
As he began to return to the hangar, his proximity alarms went off, and his radar tech warned him of incoming ships. Junichi spun around, his suit's monoeye flitting around until it zoomed in on three escaping Public class ships. A smile crept across his face. "Looks like we get to play after all..."
<br><br>
With out saying a word, a compliment of standard zaku kai's evacuated the ship and formed up behind the SS officer. He pushed off from the bow and sped off after the Federation transports. 
<br><br>
He drew his Panzerfaust and let it loose towards the head ship, the artillery slamming right into the bottom of the ship, sending it up in a twisted explosion. As the other two ships saw it explode they split up. Junichi loved it when they tried to run. 
<br><br>
Motioning with the zaku's hands, he split his team up, and they quickly dispatched of the last two public ships. The Schutzstaffel liason surveyed the battlefield and decided that Veronica Wu could handle herself; the Schutzstaffel was no longer needed. The SS squad retreated to the zanzibar and made their way to the rendevouz point.
<br>
<center><font color="3300ff" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
As Felix was busy slaying ships and toying with the remaining Saberfish, Caleb Degrau and a squad of zaku kai's positioned themselves, his suit sporting the Cannon refit. He had his target. The Gelgoog Cannon found a firing solution on the Agincourt, and with out much resistance, fired. Much to his dismay the shot was intercepted, the Madras sliding in the line of fire to cover Tianem's escape.
<br><br>
"Son of a bitch..." Caleb bit his tongue and took aim again, the zaku kai's fighting off the saberfishes, now that they had their attention. He didn't hesitate as he fired a hole through the side of the Salamis, destroying it as he pierced its hull. The Gelgoog pilot looked to regain sight on the Agincourt but it had slinked away. "Damnit..."
<br>
<center><font color="3300ff" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Crazed laughter seemed to echo inside his cockpit as Emil sliced through another Ball fighter, the Federation mobile suit exploding and shaking the Rick Dom II. The unstable pilot waded through the battlefield, leaving a path of lifeless Federal suits, and his personal suit sporting what looked like scars from a drawn out battle. 
<br><br>
<b> "I AM INVINCIBLE!" </b>
<br><br>
Emil screamed as a GM's beam rifle took off the Rick Dom's arm; as far as he was concerned he couldn't die. The suit shuddered from impact, but he hit the throttle and was on the suit in the blink of an eye, slicing it in half with his saber. 
<br><br>
"You must not have heard me, you can't kill me... fools..." As he turned to face the Agincourt he saw a flurry of missiles barreling straight for him. He shrugged it off, and faced the incoming barrage defiantly. 
<br><br>
As the closed the distance, Emil took out his bazooka and fired past the missiles, shooting several rounds at the escaping Agincourt. As he did, missiles began exploding as pink lances of beam energy began piercing them. Emil looked around frantically, what was this?
<br><br>
"Are you nuts?! You're going to get yourself killed Myberg!" Banks had arrived with Anya Wilds and several zaku Kai's for back up. Admist the reinforcements Emil could see the familiar bits belonging to his friend Florian. Before he knew it the missiles had been dispatched but the Agincourt had made it away from the mess.
<br><br>
Emil began to shake as he looked at his comrades, he was slowly coming out of his mad craze, and just in time as he looked at the damage report on his suit, he had lost a leg and an arm, and suffered more damage than he had realized in his blitz against Tianem.
