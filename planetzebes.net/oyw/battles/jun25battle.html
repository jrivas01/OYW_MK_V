<br>
Howling winds blanket the city of New York.  The thrice already has the coastal city seen sieges by the Earth Federal Forces and the Duchy of Zeon.  Once a busy city of nearly 30 million citizens, less than a thousand are left.
<br><br>
Amongst the rubble, a handful of hidden antiair batteries are all the marks the military presence in the city.  The Federal soldiers manning the AA and SAM weapons pull their jackets close as the wind rips through the city.  There aren't even enough personnel to even delegate sentries on the perimeter.
<br><br>
This was noticed by hidden figures in the war torn city.  Unseen to the Federal garrsion, Zeon Marines made their way through the bombed out landscape.
<br><br>
A sergeant and his squad crawled into a makeshift command post in the wreckage of a collapsed building.  "Major, sir.  All squads are in position.  Recon of the barracks reports it empty and nothing but clerks in the communications tower and their HQ."
<br><br>
"Looks like we're good to go," the major concluded.  He checks his watch.  "Someone make sure that Private Uruk is still awake and in position.  Last thing I need is for him to wander off like a damn puppy."
<br><br>
As the radio operator got to work, the major turn back to the officers and NCOs around him.  "Okay, get the word down the line, we deploy in five minutes."
<br><br>

<br>
It was a very odd feeling for Private Gilgamos Uruk.  He clenched his hand over the controls again just to see if he really was here.  Sometimes Uruk would wonder how he got back to being a pilot, especially of this goofy thing they call a "Zock".  All Uruk can recall is Tony Knight and how he trust him.  Trust him enough to turn from being a doctor and back to a pricate.
<br><br>
"<i>... Uruk!</i>"
<br><br>
Huh?
<br><br>
"<i>Goddamnit Uruk! We need fire suppression on these coordinates...!</i>"
<br><br>
Oh right.
<br><br>
Like a supernatural monster rising from the darkest parts of the ocean's depths, the Zock burst from the water.  The howling wind and crashing water make it seem as the Zeon machine was roaring like a primal beast.
<br><br>
Uruk's fingers move with a mind of their own, as if they remember more than he does.  The Zock's foreward Mega Particle Cannons charge and with a flash of light, lanced out.
<br><br>
One of the AA gun stations was able to depress its barrels low enough to fire upon the Zeon marine squads.  The high velocity rounds are deadly against infantry and the Zeon soldiers assigned to take this position are forced into cover.  Suddenly, a flash and explosion as the mega particle blasts from the Zock vaporizes the battery.
<br><br>
Elsewhere, the rest of the attack is going smoothly.  Doors are kicked in and small arms fire rang out as key buildings are taken.  Uruk listen as he is directed from one sector to another, acting as the heavy weapons platform.  Much to the annoyance of the commanding major, Uruk took it upon himself to watch out for any civilians running past his feet.
<br><br>
By the time the sun set, the city of New York is once again in Zeon hands.  Uruk's work isn't done however.  Once he saw the Zeon marines rounding up POWs, Uruk exchanged his pilot suit for a doctor's medical kit and began checking the wounded.  FOr both Federal and Zeon injured.
