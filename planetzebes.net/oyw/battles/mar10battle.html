Aisha Vemunio's Gundam Ground Type hid, as much a a white, blue and red giant robot can hide, waiting for her target to appear. High water on Ellis Island made the easy routes with good visibility impassable for typical land vehicles. Soon her quarry came into view. Trudging along the washed out dirt road, a column of tanks and IFV's known as the TAF 1st Armored crept along.
<br><br>
"They call this a road?" One of the Weasel drivers complained.
<br><br>
"It's like we've climbed out of the mudhole...into the mudhole...I'm not even sure which."
<br><br>
"Cut the chatter, Luggun unit, can you see anything from up there?" The lead Magella commander ordered, popping his head out of the Magella Top and looking skyward.
<br><br>
In the skies above, the Luggun crew scanned the ground for signs of enemy units. Giant footprints in the muddy terrain was a pretty good indicator.
<br><br>
"Commander be advised, mobile suit in the area, we don't have a solid location yet, recommend you hold position, over."
<br><br>
A muffled beeping alerted Aisha to the Luggun's movements, shown on a small PiP view from an axillary camera. Slowly, she raised the barrel of her 100mm machinegun...
<br><br>
"Hey what's that?"
<br><br>
"What's what?"
<br><br>
"That! The shiny thing under the tree-line!"
<br><br>
"Looks like an antenna... Oh crap! Commander! Enemy unit sighted! Location Zero-Two-Niner Mark--!" His words were cut off by machinegun fire shredding the recon plane. Nevertheless, the commander got the location of the enemy clearly enough when it stood to full height, revealing a mud-covered Gundam-type.
<br><br>
"Shit! It's a feddie high-end unit! All units take aim and fire!" The commander shouted, dropping into his seat and hurrying to align his own cannon on the Gundam. The first volley of 175mm cannon shots missed completely as the mobile suit sprinted to flank them. The faster Weasels trained their 40mm autocannons on the machine, spraying six-shot bursts at intervals to effectively lay down a constant stream of fire.
<br><br>
Aisha raised her shield and kept moving. The shells, small by mobile suit standards, bouncing off her shield, scratching and chipping away at it. Skidding to a halt in the slushy terrain, she took aim from behind the column, opening fire with the 100mm again, this time carving a swath through two of the Weasels.  
<br><br>
"There shouldn't be Federation units here!" The remaining Weasel's gunner cried, panic-firing another burst at the machine, and noticing the emblem on it's shoulder. "AU!? Damn, they've got equipment like this?"
<br><br>
Aisha aimed for the final weasel, but caught sight of the Magellas rotating for another volley. Shielding her main camera, she switched to multi-launcher and fired a flashbang, sidestepping to throw off the tanks' aim. She could hear the volley, and as the light began to fade she realigned with the nearest Magella. Before she could fire, another warning alarm directed her attention downward just before a marine fired his PZF 3 rocket. She leaned the mobile suit back, nearly toppling over in the mud, but evading the rocket narrowly. Switching to her chest vulcan, she aimed down at the marines and jumped backward, raining lead down on the infantry. The landing didn't go as planned however, and the Gundam's feet skidded right out from under it, landing the mobile suit firmly on it's rear.
<br><br>
Not to waste the opportunity, the Magellas hastily fired on the downed enemy, not waiting for a precise firing solution. Cannon shells smashed the muddy landscape all around her. Inside the cockpit, Aisha couldn't help but grind her teeth as she hurried to adjust her plan of attack and get her machine upright. Launching a smoke round to help prevent a solid hit, she managed to get to her feet and reload the machinegun. This time flanking left of the tanks, she wasted no time in firing while running a circle, cutting down two magellas while returning to her original position. Her machinegun out, she peppered the tanks with her vulcan while dropping the gun in favor of a beam saber. As she zeroed in on one tank it's top section split off and fired. In the blink of an eye she had her shield up to take the hit, but the high penetration round drilled straight through it, shearing her Gundam's fingers off and ricocheting into the head, disabling her cameras.
<br><br>
"OH YOU SON OF A WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON YOU!!!!!!!" Aisha shouted angrily, slamming her hand down on the controls, inadvertently opening the hatch allowing her to see. The smoke had drifted back in front of her, but she could make out the form of the Magella top. A Giant hand reached out of the smoke, grabbing the Top by it's cannon and swinging it like a hammer on it's neighbor. Just one tank and the IFV to go.
<br><br>
"Oh god... we're no match for it!" the Weasel gunner screamed, his driver was beginning to agree with him wholeheartedly.
<br><br>
"Hold your ground soldier!" The commander shouted, "It's not over yet!"
<br><br>
"It is for us!" The Weasel driver yelped, flooring the gas and making a dash for anywhere but there. Unfortunately his escape attempt brought him directly in the path of the rampaging Aisha, who simply punted the IFV, emptying a few rounds into it's exposed underside and exploding it.
<br><br>
"Ugh... maybe retreat is the only option..." The commander mused, ordering his driver to back up as the Gundam came rushing toward him, beam saber now drawn and ready to slice the tank to pieces.
<br><br>
"You're not getting away!" Aisha shouted, stabbing down just as the commander tried to eject his Magella Top, crushing it back into the tank base and melting a large hole in both.

"So, some git wants to spar with me in a tank? His loss." Edmund confirmed himself. He then chuckled. 
<br><br>
Maybe this spar would get his mind of his deployment during Odessa. Until this far, Edmund could safely say he wasn't in anything too stressful, and if he was, he managed to escape with his life. Now with things escalating at a level comparable to when the war first started, the next week would be worrisome indeed. 
<br><br>

<br>
"I heard that, and your hubris will be your downfall." interupted Gray, as he passed Edmund 
<br><br>
"Elementary, my dear Gray. This war, and especially the Federation, will be my downfall. Perhaps you could also factor those maniacs in space. Now if I was running things...nevermind, let us just get on with it, I much rather get back to more important matters." replied Edmund, who then got into the cockpit of his Mass Produced Gundam.
<br><br>
It took a lot to convince him to spar with Gray, as he originally didn't want to, or more so didn't want to put the effort in. He would have even gone as far enough to fake an illness, but he was begining to warm up to his fellow Federation pilots, but not the Federation itself. 
<br><br>
The match started with a nice gentlemanly countdown; a boon Edmund would grant none of his enemies. The spar was initiated, with Gray taking the first shot with his Type 61's main cannons. Edmund dashed to the right spraying his vulcans while doing so. The vulcans splattered behind the type 61, as Gray accelerated forward.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Gray forced the tank into a steep left turn, to face his opponent, blaring machinegun fire. Edmund responded by kneeling down and using his shield to block the shots. Edmund also used the cover to safely fire paint balls back at his opponent. Gray accelerated forward straight into the Mass Produced Gundam, as he saw it as his one of his only options. The sheer force of the blow knocked Edmund on his ass. He quickly reacted, finding stable footing. While doing so, he recieved a point blanc shot of paint from the 61's main cannons.
<br><br>
"How Admirable. Firing at your enemy while they are down. That sounds like I strategy I would use." commented Edmund, both embarassed by his defeat, and respectful of his opponent.

<br><br>
In the midst of the bollocks fleet, a GM Command and a GM Sniper II met far from the fleet for a little training session which would help prepare for the coming weeks.
<br><br>
"Alright, just a quick spar. Nothing too stressful, think you could handle that?" asked Patrick Foley.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Michael Kreuz responded with silence, and a simple nod. He also prepared his rifle, activating his advanced targeting visor to assist with the spar. He shook his head back, to adjust his bangs so that they no longer blocked his vision and his baby blue eyes.
<br><br>
The fight commenced, and Michael easily managed to tag Patrick with a well placed shot from his sniper rifle.
<br><br>
"I bet you wont be able to do that again!" shouted Patrick, responding with his beam gun. He also used several a dummy balloon grenades, chucking them ahead of him, which allowed him to be protected from sniper fire as Michael's focus was diverted.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Michael took cover with his shield, protecting himself from Patrick's attacks. The grenades were still a problem though, and there was no way he could snipe them all before they would slam into his unit. He used his vulcans to quickly dispose of them.
<br><br>
The distraction allowed Patrick to sneak up on his opponent, but to his surprise his opponent was ready for him. Both pilots had drawn their weapons on each other at point black.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Looks like a tie." commented Michael.
<br><br>
"That's bollocks!" cursed Patrick, taking note of his lose. In his book, if you didn't win, you lost.
<br><br>
"It is the name of the fleet..." Michael quietly responded.
<br><br>
