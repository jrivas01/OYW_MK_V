At this stage of the One Year War, Zeon had fielded its most powerful units. In the area of newtype research, a fully complete version of the experimental newtype mobile suit 'Perfect Zeong' had come into the hands of Florian Cuyler, reknowned space ace of the Mobile Assault Force. Flying through the Zeon Expeditionary Fleet, its large size made it a sight to behold for those observing.
<br><br>
In the area of oldtype combat units, there is little that surpasses the Gelgoog Marine Commander. Sporting 40mm vulcans on its head, 100mm arm machine cannons on its arms, beam sabers and a 90mm hand held machine-gun with grenade launcher, it's more than a match for the typical federal mobile suit. At the hands of distinguished oldtype Liutenant Richard Banks of the Space Assault Force, even it could give the Perfect Zeong a run for its money.
<br><br>
And there, between these two bastions of the Zeon Military Force, there was a Gattle. Fighter bomber. 40mm vulcans. 10 missiles. Hardpoints for oversized missiles. At its helm, the insane space cowboy, Ray Walker. With this tiny little thing, he had beached gargantuan Salamis like Texas Cattle. The pilot was a mad man, to be sure, but had no shortage of eagerness to battle.
<br><br>
The three units hovered in the space among the Zeon Expeditionary Fleet, shadowed by the <i>Athena's Wrath.</i> Notably absent was the fleet's usual Commander, Veronica Wu. Nonetheless, the mobile suit pilots of the fleet were no sleeping audience. Bets were being set like no one's business. Three to one for Zeong to beat Gelgoog. Sixty five to one for anything to beat Gattle.
<br><br>
Two veteran pilots did their final checks - low beam settings and paint rounds. Florian looked for his triggers - not the same place on the Val Varo, but doable. Richard Banks was calm, yet bursting with excitement to get the new mobile suit moving. Even faster than his old Rick Dom! But one person didn't have to do any checks. One person knew his machine better than the back of his hand. And he would score the first kill.
<br><br>
The Gattle's thrusters burst, taking the tiny unit from unmoving to full power within seconds. It flashed over the face of the Zeong, which released inaccurate MPC fire in surprise. The tiny Gattle weaved around the beams, moving between them in a zig zag. Meanwhile, the Gelgoog Marine jumped into the action, taking advantage of the action to strafe the Zeong with even more fire. Wire guided hands shot through the shells, detonating the paint rounds pre-maturely.
<br><br>
The two mobile suits faced off, clearly having prepared for each other. The deft Gelgoog attacked with continuous fire, while the Zeong responded with an all out barrage. There were so many beams, the Gelgoog dropped all thoughts of scoring a hit to protect itself. Retreating with high power thrusters, the Gelgoog withdrew, the Zeong hot on its trail. Wanting to test all the capabilities of his machine, the MPCs fell silent. One fully charged barrage and his target couldn't escape. Florian concentrated, trying to block out the gnat-like Gattle coming from.. behind?
<br><br>
Bang! Two anti-ship missile hit the Zeong dead on. The missiles were of such a magnatude that the paint coated the torso, freezing quickly with the sub-zero temperatures of space. Ray chuckled to himself, passing over the head of the mobile suit as he passed by. All those doo-hickeys didn't mean anything when you're a giant bullseye. Ray jettisoned the other two, increasing his speed by tossing dead weight.
<br><br>
The Gelgoog had taken its time to re-adjust itself, and was more than ready to respond in kind. 90mm shells rocketed past the Gattle, the insane Ray Walker flying straight into the fire. In his haste to test his new unit, Richard Banks hadn't set the calibration right, and as such was firing at 2 degrees to his left. And that was just what Ray needed. At almost point blank range, the guns of the Gattle finally fired, sending 40mm rounds and a full salvo of ten missiles at the Gelgoog. It fired at the missiles with its giant forearm mounted machine cannons, but nothing could be done for the 40mm rounds. Seven hit the cockpit door, denting it a bit and giving Banks a fright.
<br><br>
Feeling ever the victor, Ray buzzed the Gelgoog, doing a victory lap around the combat area. He hadn't yet been registered as the victor, but left it to computer error. Two more kills to the winning streak. He prepared to buzz the headless Zeong, laughing to himself - when Florian shot him from behind. The Gattle spun, scortched by the tiny unit's mega partile gun. The Zeong's head floated jovially, the lone survivor of the exchange. New technology is full of surprises.

Two of the Duchy's newest model mobile suits walked along the shoreline as they patrolled the area for any threats. The two officers had decided that it was in their best interest to be prepared as they entered Federal Territory. Esther was more than eager to take the lead on their scouting mission, always the glory hog. Tony happily went along with the idea, not caring to debate the topic with the crazy Mobile Assault lady.
<br><br>
"Everything seems to be golden." Esther smiled approvingly as she enjoyed the cinematic-esque scene the two created walking along the beach with the sun setting behind them. "Coast is Cle-"
<br><br>
<b>KABOOM!!</b>
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
Esther looked around to see where the thunderous crack had originated from, when all of a sudden she heard the familiar sound of artillery whistling through the air. She began to panic.
<br><br>
<b>tink...</b>
<br><br>
Shells struck the Gyan and the Gelgoog both in the back harmlessly, and comedically, jolting the two pilots slightly in their seats. Seething with anger Esther turned to see two type 61 tanks that had wandered too far from their squad. With a smirk, and a slight adjustment of her scarf she measured up the two tanks. As they clumsily tried to turn around and flee after being sighted, the Gyan ran up on one and with a swift kick, booted the tank off the beach. Seeing this, Tony excitedly ran up and did much the same to the other one.
<br><br>

<br>
"Oh shit! Retreat! That bitch is crazy!" The remaining tanks turned tail and ran away.
<br><br>

<br>
"What is that on sonar?" The Captain of the Avalon looked at two sinking signatures that had appeared out of nowhere.
<br><br>
"Uh, visual contacts are registering the signatures to belong to..." He paused for a moment.
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
"Um, sir, they're Type 61's, Sir..." The radar tech shook his head in disbelief and let out a sigh.
