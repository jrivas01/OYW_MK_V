It is a long trip from the battlefield of Odessa, but they've made it.
<br><br>
Bright Noah watched as the continent of Europe passed under the White Base as it limps across the English Channel.  The only thing keeping the assault carrier flying is the Minovsky Craft system, which is at the straining point.  The battle of Odessa was hard on them all.  The stress of combat combined with the nuclear attack and then the nearby miss by the Apsalus II has exhausted the crew.
<br><br>
Suddenly the radio operator spoke up.  "Sir, General Revil is on the line."
<br><br>
Bright saw Amuro, Sayla, Kai, and Hayato walk through the bridge doors at that moment.  Good timing on their part, thought Bright as he picked up the handset on his command chair.  "Put him on the main viewer."
<br><br>
The screen blinks to life in a hail of static and the usual telltales of Minovsky interference.  Despite this, Bright can recognize the face of General Revil.
<br><br>
"Sir!" saluted Bright," what can I do for you?"
<br><br>
"<i>As ease...  I just want to first offer my congratulations to you and your crew on helping us capture Odessa...</i>" said General Revil before coughing loudly.  Kai and Hayato exchanged a look as Amuro stepped closer to the screen.  Sayla glanced at Amuro, with concern.
<br><br>
"Are you alright sir?" asked Bright Noah politely.
<br><br>
"<i>I'll live</i>," remarks Revil between coughs,"<i> Zeon nearly got lucky with that nuclear weapon...</i>"
<br><br>
Bright Noah's hand tightens until his knuckles turned white.
<br><br>
"<i>... I have new orders for White Base</i>," announced Revil after regaining his composure,"<i> you will be briefed when you arrive at Belfast.  I will be meeting you there.</i>"
<br><br>
"Understood sir," confirmed Bright.
<br><br>
Revil's eyes blinked a few times.  "<i>Is that Amuro Ray?</i>"
<br><br>
"I'm here," replied Amuro, cutting Bright Noah off before he can say anything.
<br><br>
"<i>I see... good job shooting down that mobile armor</i>," said Revil," <i> had it fired, the attack would have turned into shambles... I am promoting you one rank for your efforts.</i>"
<br><br>
"Thank you?" replied Amuro.
<br><br>
"<i>Indeed... I'll see you all at Belfast.</i>"  The viewer clicked off.
<br><br>
"Look's like the general has a new favorite," jeered Kai.  Amuro shot a glare at him.
<br><br>
"Knock it off," hushed Hayato.
<br><br>
"It won't be much longer until we reach Belfast," reminded Bright," so I suggest the bunch of you get ready.  Fast."
<br><br>

<br>
The sky is clear over the city of Belfast.  The urban fortress on the coast of Ireland is the main nerve center of the EFGF's drive into Europe. Like a warhorse coming back to the stable to rest, the White Base glided over the city towards the Repair Bay.
<br><br>
The EFGF military tries to hide the passing and going of Federal units from Belfast.  But there are practical limitations.  Today is one of them as a red-headed woman snaps pictures of the White Base from afar, recording its every movement until it is moored in dry dock.
<br><br>
Miles off shore, a man who is well-known for the color red has his thoughts interrupted by a yeoman.
<br><br>
"Sir!  We have intelligence from our informant on the mainland!"
<br><br>
Char Aznable turned and took the message slip from the Zeon sailor.  He read the summary and then leafed through the first set of photographs.
<br><br>
"Inform the commander the bring the Mad Angler about and maintain silent running," ordered the Red Comet," I will be meeting him and the other officers on the bridge momentarily."
<br><br>
"Yes sir!"
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The moment White Base touched down, mechanics and work crews scrambled over her battered hull.  Work gangs and supply platoons race into the assault carrier like busy ants.  Amuro and Hayato watched the commotion from afar, both of them leaning against the giant tank threads of the Guntank.  Suddenly something caught Hayato's eye.
<br><br>
"Hey Kai, where are you going?!" Hayato calls out.
<br><br>
"I'm taking a DAMN walk, what does it look like?" spat back Kai as he walked past them.
<br><br>
"We've need to be at that meeting soon."
<br><br>
"Bite me, I'll be there when I get there."
<br><br>
It took a few minutes for Kai to get past the checkpoint but there in front of him stood the streets of Belfast-
<br><br>
"Hey there!  Can I interest you in some charms?"
<br><br>
And of course, a street vendor.
<br><br>
"Go grab an unemployment ticket-" Kai began.  Then he blinked.
<br><br>
"Sir?" quizzed the woman as she brushes a lock of red hair away from her eyes.
<br><br>
"Er...."
