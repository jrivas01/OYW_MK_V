<br><br>
The air is salty and a slight mist spills over the edge of the barge.  But Thorvald Siggurdson doesn't mind.  When he isn't fighting the Earth Federal war against the Duchy of Zeon, he is fighting the mystery of his mobile suit.
<br><br>
The blue colored mobile suit named the Blue Destiny lay dormant on the barge as Siggurdson approaches the Pacific Coast of the North American continent.  He had heard the faery within the mobile suit more than once and is thoroughly convinced that it is a monkey.
<br><br>
With an enthusiastic heave, the EF test pilot pulls himself ontop of the cockpit hatch.  Taking a swing of his canteen, Siggurdson turns around on the ledge of the Blue Destiny's chest and stares at the dull red visor before him.
<br><br>
"Now here be the tale 'Deep are the Iceland Channel'," began Siggurdson with a grin.
<br><br>
<center><i>
<br>"Once upon a time there was a trollwife,
<br>who intended to wade to Iceland from Norway.
<br>She had learned that on the way there were
<br>deep channels en route, and it is related
<br>that she said to another trollwife:
<br>"Deep are the Iceland channels,
<br>yet they are fordable."
<br>But she added that a narrow channel
<br>was in the middle of the ocean, which was so deep
<br>that her head would get wet.
<br>Then she set out, and as she came to the
<br>channel she feared the most; she tried to catch
<br>hold of a ship sailing by, to
<br>use as a support over the channel.
<br>But she missed the ship and her feet slipped,
<br>so she fell into the channel and drowned.
<br>Her body was washed ashore at
<br>RauÄŸisandur (Red Beach), and was so big,
<br>that a man on horseback could not reach with his whip
<br>up to the back of her bent knee, as she
<br>lay dead and stiff on the beach."
</i></center>
<br><br>
With his tale done, Siggurdson roars with laughter.  "HA!  She might have been BLUE like YOU! HA HA!"
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
But the Blue Destiny wasn't the only one listening in on Siggurdson's story.  High above him, hidden in the white clouds are the aircraft of the 14th Airborne patrol.  Their Luggun had spotted the sea barge off the coast and the Dopps went to afterburner to intercept it before it can reach land.
<br><br>
Siggurdson was about to start another tale when the first burst of vulcan fire tore up the water twenty meters to port.  He rolled over back into the cockpit right as the rounds plink off the lunar titanium armor.
<br><br>
A string of profanity echoes around the confines of the cockpit as Siggurdson takes aim.  The Blue Destiny's twin 60mm head vulcans belch flame as tracers reach up after the aircraft.  One Dopp took a glancing hit to a wing and collides with the rough waves of the Pacific Ocean.
<br><br>
The Blue Destiny is sitting up now with its 100mm machinegun blasting at the returning Dopps.  The wall of projectiles took out another Dopp but not before the 14th Airborne released its entire missile payload.
<br><br>
Siggurdson clenches his teeth as the barge explodes around him, shaking him inside his protective lunar titanium shell.  Then a final violent crash as the Blue Destiny enters the water.  Up above, the 14th Airborne saw the mobile suit splash into the water.  Content, they left back for the mainland.
<br><br>
"I am NOT A TROLLWIFE!" Siggurdson defiantly declared.

<br>
"I don't think so!" Caleb grunted as the unwieldy Zaku collided with his prototype Gelgoog. Nadia's heat hawk clashed with her opponent's heat saber, the two surfaces glowing brighter as they grinded against each other. The frame of the Zaku MPSET shuddered as the Caleb kicked out with his suit, abruptly seperating the two. 
<br><br>
"I'm not fast enough..." Nadia tried to swing her suit around, the twin binders slowing the suit as it tried to counter the Gelgoog's advance. "Shit..." She grunted as she was caught in the back with a strike from Caleb's heat saber. As the arrogant pilot retracted his blade from one of the binders, he was caught off guard as they were forcibly ejected from the Zaku, sending his blade floating into space still embedded into the MPS Equipment. 
<br><br>
"You bi-" He stopped, reminding himself that it was just a spar, and turned his attention back to his opponent. The Zaku had become much less impressive in appearance after shedding the massive binders, but it still retained its tail binders and fuel cells. The Gelgoog pilot chuckled to himself, viewing the manuever as a move of desperation and began to press forward once more, feeling more confident than ever that he had the win secured.
<br><br>
"Let's see what this can do." Nadia mused to herself as she checked her systems quickly, preparing to fight for the first time with out her MPS Equipment. She looked up to see Caleb charging, grabbing his heat saber from the floating binders as he dashed at the Zaku. "Now or never Nadia..." She pulled back on the thrusters, and rolled her suit out the way, much to both combatants' surprise. She allowed a slight smile at the improvement in mobility.
<br><br>
Caleb stopped for a second, his confidence waivering for a second as he processed the drastic change in manuverability. Once he regained his composure he shrugged it off and made one last charge towards Nadia. "Dodge this!" He rolled in, thrusting his saber towards the tail binders of the Zaku. In return Nadia boosted to the side and swung down with her heathawk. Both pilots were rewarded with strikes as they came to a stop, the Heathawk buried into the Gelgoog's left shoulder, disabling the whole arm, and a heat saber cut into the Zaku's left leg.
<br><br>
"Draw?" 
<br><br>
"It would seem that way sir..."

<br>
Alain Grace was happy to be out of the jungle, the fetid forests of Manila and a lack of substances keeping him leagues away from his prime. He had just arrived in California Base a few hours ago, and had already met with his dealer. It was not that he didn't like being sent into combat, it was just that here he felt much more comfortable than in the great outdoors.
<br><br>
A meeting had been scheduled with some defector scientist, something something Morses whom Grace hadn't really paid much attention to. He was driving towards an empty testing field in a jeep, and at the same time sailing through the clouds, trying to avoid the huge snake encircling the sun. It called to him, but Grace paid it no heed. He was flying towards a better horizon.
<br><br>
The man was small, just small enough to fit in between two of the eighteen toes of the blue mobile suit before him. He seemed to shrink while he spoke, the melodious hum of his voice a stark contrast to his face, which was melting and changing, disfiguring and refiguring itself with each harmonic sentence. Grace couldn't quite make out what he was saying, and really, wouldn't it all be the same. Failure this, test pilot that, useless, not special. At least his face wasn't melting.
<br><br>
"This system, private Grace... This system will make you a newtype."
<br><br>
It was only then that Alain began paying attention.
