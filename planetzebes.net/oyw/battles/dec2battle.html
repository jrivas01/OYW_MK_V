<br>
Though the siege had ended Manila still appeared to be a base on high alert. Ships were in the air and suits were on patrol. However the base was far from fully staffed. Holes were bound to appear in their defenses. One so happened to appear in the waters of the port.

Hirsch tensed as his suit final penetrated the port of Manila. He could feel the sweat running down the back of his neck under his suit. For the past two hours he'd been moving his suit along towards the port by hugging the bottom of the sea floor. It had been a very difficult and time consuming process. Hirsch was hoping it would turn out to be worth the effort. "Believe it or not that was the easy part." he thought to himself.
<br><br>
"Here we go." he said as he carefully pushed his suit off the dark floor of the port.The world around him slowly became lighter as he closed in on the surface. Hirsch knew if he was going to be caught at this point it'd be now. Hirsch felt himself get even more tense as he gripped his controls tightly just as the head of his suit broke the water. Acting quickly Hirsch panned the head of his suit around recording his findings. "That should be enough." he thought and proceeded to dive his suit back down. The darkness of the sea floor was surprisingly welcome.
<br><br>
"To bad I can't do a little more." Hirsch thought.He proceeded to let out a deep sigh when his suits had finally drifted back to the sea floor in the port. "Time to get this data back to the others." he said to himself. With that he began the time consuming process of pulling himself out of the port. His suit hugged the floor and he began pulling himself towards the exit of the port.
