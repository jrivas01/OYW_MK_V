The Blue planet glistened with the sun's rays, its scars from humanity's crimes still evident. They were a grim reminder of Mahara Villina's past as she took a quick glance through a starboard window aboard the Horseman's Banquet. The cargo ship had approached earth's orbit as Mahara concerned herself with other matters, first and foremost; her training.
<br><br>
Mahara was about ready to call it quits for the day, so She had slipped out of her regular leather pants by unfastening her luna titanium belt buckle. Sweat dripped from her forehead as her hair was moistened, turning from a shade of maple to a dark amber. Her corset would soon follow, and she hopped into the shower.
<br><br>

<br>
Meanwhile the cargo ship was approaching Earth's Orbit, which was cluttered by old shuttle wreckage and minor asteroids. The small ship easily cleared through the space debris, left over from over a century of space exploration. Yet another osbtacle stood in its way, two Musai class ships. The cargo ship could have outmanuvered one of them, but the other would only flank it.
<br><br>
The Musai scout ship hailed the Horseman's Banquet. A Zeon officer by the name of Boone demanded permission to board. Jarl, the Banquet's communications officer rushed to the captain's quarters to alert Mahara of the situation. He banged on the door and called her name.
<br><br>

<br>
"This better be important." commented Mahara as she wrapped a towel around her head, to dry her soaking hair.
<br><br>
"I wouldn't have called if it wasn't, captain." replied Jarl."Two musais have us surrounded."
<br><br>
Mahara was fortunately already drying herself. Not caring for her still wet hair, she slid on her padded long sleeved shrug, over the approptiate undergarments. She made her way to the bridge, following Jarl casually. She did not care if she took up someone elses time, as was her nature. Upon finally reaching the bridge, her promary view was that of a impatient zeon officer, red in the face.
<br><br>
"I'm going to have to ask you a couple questions." stated Boone. "What is your purpose for traversing here?"
<br><br>
"Vacation." responded Mahara, obviously lying, and treating the officer as if he were a lowly airport security attendent.
<br><br>
"Hmmmf, somehow I don't believe you. We are going to have to board your ship." replied Boone.
<br><br>
"What ever for?" asked Mahara, falsifying her innocence.
<br><br>
"Standard procedure if I suspect anything." replied Boone.
<br><br>
"Fine, do what you like." retorted Mahara, she was just anxious to end the interrogation.
<br><br>
Several soldiers boarded and began seraching every crevice of the transport ship, finding nothing.
<br><br>

<br>
"If you'd like I can have you check the air-ducts, I'm sure I'm smuggling top secret Federation Mobile Suits in them." she brought up, hinting at her anger.
<br><br>
"No thats fine. You are to turn back from where you came from. I don't ever want to see this damn ship again." ordered Boone, angered at how he had made been made to look like a fool.
<br><br>
The two Musais departed, and the Horseman's Banquet turned around as commanded.
<br><br>
"Heh, maybe we'll try again tomorow." muttered Mahara.
