<br>
<i>"You going to share that?"</i>
<br><br>
"No..."
<br><br>
<i>"Why are you so selfish?"</i>
<br><br>
"No! I need to make this last me... you don't even eat anyways."
<br><br>
<i>What is with this guy? Why won't he leave me in peace?</i>
<br><br>
Emil began to twitch as the ghost of Lars continued to nag him. The voice seemed to hover around his cockpit, chiming in whenever he pleased; his solitude had begun to make Lars seem less like a figment of his imagination and more like a real person with each passing day in side 4. The young federation pilot plugged his ears with his fingers and began taunting his companion, but his relapse into childhood was interupted as his target came up on his scanners. Emil quickly sat up in his chair, throwing his, less than desirable, food off his lap.
<br><br>
"Damnit!... I guess you can have some now..." The pilot grimaced at the thought of wasted food, but was more focused on his task at hand; he didn't want to risk pissing off Ensign Golini - what a scary man. The GM pilot took a deep breath and swallowed his fear as he armed his suit with its Machine gun and approached the Zeon's Overlord 5. 
<br><br>
<i>"Mmm, this is tasty... I don't know wh..."</i>
<br><br>
"Shush... you'll give us away!" 
<br><br>
The image of the fallen Federation soldier seemed to carelessly float behind Emil's chair, looking over his shoulder, observing every thing he did and slipping smart ass comments here and there. 
<br><br>
"Shut up!!" Emil erupted at his companion, quickly realizing what he just did as his eyes grew big and he covered his mouth. "Oh shi..."
<br><br>
<i>"Way to go... you're a genuis Emil!"</i> An almost comical smile spread across Lars' face as he heckled the lonely pilot. Emil just hung his head in shame as his sensors began to pick up the deployment of several mobile suits and what appeared to be a fighter craft. 
<br><br>
"Oh great, they've been shopping..." The young pilot let out a sigh as he reigned his fear back under control and readied to engage the enemies. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
A platoon of red eyes burned brightly against the cold steel and black armor of the Panzergrenadier squad as they manned the main bay door of Overlord five. The three Zaku II's took off above their heads, followed by the lone Gattle as they went to engage the approaching Federation mobile suit. The Schutzstaffel stood at the ready to defend their commander's mine; the group of shock troopers had been assigned to Laredo Veil and were prepared to make their Lord Gihren, and Untersharfuhrer Veil proud.
<br><br>
The three Zaku's weaved in and out of each other's wake as they proceeded to close the distance between them and Emil's GM-E. With out giving the enemy a chance to react, all three suits fanned out and began blanketing space with a hail of fire from their machine guns. As their bullets lit up space, the Gattle came soaring in from above them, nose vulcans blazing.
<br><br>
"Really? This is all your fault Lars." The cowardly pilot squirmed in his seat as he tried to turtle behind his tower shield. The front of his shield became riddled with dents as the bullets began to eat away at Emil's defense; parts of his shoulder armor and leg armor began to chip away as bullets that made it past the shield knicked his suit. The young pilot cursed under his breath as he started to get the urge to run away.
<br><br>
<i>Goloni...</i>
<br><br>
The thought of his Ensign, and the fear of being betrayed and killed by his own officer upon failure, over powered that of his current enemy. Trying to react quickly, he ejected the shield, tossing it towards the incoming Gattle. The Gattle barrel rolled to the left to avoid the flying piece of scrap, but was caught by a grenade that Emil had thrown in the shield's wake, blowing a hole in the aircraft, destroying it.
<br><br>
The three Zaku's faultered for a second as they saw the explosion at the top of their displays, giving Emil enough time to adjust and return fire with his own Machine gun. Before the Zeon mobile suits could resume their attack pattern the left most Zaku fell limp as its front side was littered with bullets. Sweat formed upon his brow as he began to nervously engage the last two mobile suits. The young pilot ignited his beam saber and brandished his machine gun in the opposite hand; fear had a weird way of motivating some people in the right circumstances.
<br><br>
The two remaining Zaku II's flanked Emil on either side, but using his superior skill and speed, he shot one through the chest, making his way up the suit til a bullet entered and exited the enemy's monoeye. 
<br><br>
<i>"Nice shot!</i> Lars chimed in as the Zaku's head exploded.
<br><br>
<i>"Though, might wanna watch out for..."</i> Before the ghost of the fallen soldier could finish his sentence, Emil had swung his suit around and blocked the incoming heathawk strike with his beam saber. 
<br><br>
<i>"Good Job, now parry. parry. thrust. thrust. good, good."</i> Emil did his best to ignore the taunting as he began trading blows with the Zaku II. Melee was not his forte, but he couldn't let this get away from him. After losing several more chunks of armor, and use of his right leg, the young pilot blocked an over head strike and blew a hole through the Zaku's head with his machine gun at point blank range. As the Zeon suit lost its visual sensors, the GM-E struck into its chest with his beam saber, disabling the suit. 
<br><br>
Having dispensed of all the defenses he could see, Emil armed his Bazooka and made his way towards the entrance to the mine. Now drenched in sweat, the nervous pilot leveled the Bazooka at the compound door, only to see the doors closing on dozens of defiant red glowing eyes. Shaking the eerie feeling that something was wrong, he aimed his weapon and pulled the trigger. The ballistic round hurtled through space at the Zeon mine, thudding into the door that had just closed, and then floating back into space harmlessly and almost comedically.
<br><br>
"..." Emil sunk in his chair at the site in front of him. Of all people, he would get a dud... Not to be discouraged, he anxiously took another shot, but this time was rewarded with an explosion against the blast doors. A faint smile of relief spread across his face, but was quickly replaced with disbelief as the smoke cleared to reveal the door undamaged. Before he could even sigh, the Panzergrenadier units ordered the AA guns to aim and fire. The Overlord opened fire on the enemy suit, disabling his left arm and ripping a hole through its torso jus barely missing the cockpit. 
<br><br>
"Damnit!" The anxious pilot's instincts won over this time, and his desire to run was followed. Boosting in all kinds of crazy directions, Emil managed to zig zag his way as speedily as possible away from his former target. "Another day perhaps... Don't even say it you..."
<br><br>
<i>"What?!"</i> Lars blinked as he looked at Emil in confusion...
