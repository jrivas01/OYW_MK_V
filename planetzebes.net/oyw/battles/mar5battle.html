<br>
The massive asteroid fortress of Luna II is one of the few EFSF bastions left in space.  It is protected by the dedicated Luna II Defense Fleet and is the safe haven for the weary forces of the autonomous units of the EFSF.
<br><br>
The remnants of the Damacoles Strike Force and the Cygnus Fleet congregate in the hollowed out asteroid.  But even as staff officers plan their next move against the Duchy of Zeon forces, the fighting men and women of the EFSF look to each other to keep their skills honed for the next battlefield.
<br><br>
Lieutenant Patrick "Packie" Foley pushed his feet off the side of an idle GM-E as he floated towards his MS cage.  The GM Command Space Type sat there lifeless as it waits for its master.  The British officer looked around at the mobile suits around him and came up short.
<br><br>
"Hey," he said as he grabbed a mechanic," where are the rest of my chaps?"
<br><br>
"Sir!  Officer Candidate Sentara was ordered to report to the infirmary.  Something about standing down for twenty-four hours.  Petty Officer Simmons's suit is still being put back to gether... and he's being confined to quarters for the duration sir."
<br><br>
<i>Figures</i>, thought Foley as he lets go of the mechanic,<i> Simmons got himself in such a shat-hole that they can't trust him NOT to run off with the Gundam.</i>
<br><br>

<br>
Three sparkles leave the hangars of Luna II and within minutes they cross the Defense Fleet's perimeter.
<br><br>
"<i>Foley Team, this is </i>Intimidator<i> you have clearance for your excerise in Delta-5 sector.</i>"
<br><br>
The three mobile suits waved their acknowledgement as they flew into the dark void of space.  After a while, they came to a stop.  Flying past Foley's GM Command Space Type, Seaman Derek Carter's Guncannon MPT came to a stop with Seaman Michael Kreuz's GM Sniper II.  The three MS form a triangle as they kept an eye on each other.
<br><br>
The standoff lasted until a buzzer sounded on their headsets.  The match has began.
<br><br>
Foley is the first to draw his beam gun.  The compact energy weapon came into position just as his shield did.  He need to get rid of the GM Sniper II first.  Without a doubt, the pilot will try to distant himself in order to pick off the other duelists while they battle.  Foley wants to get rid of that nusiance now before he deal with the artillery mobile suit.
<br><br>
But wishes aren't always granted.  Despite landing some glancing hits on Kruez, they are interrupted by an enormous volume of fire.  Derek Carter came bearing down on the two of them with full weapons blazing.  Empty brass shells ejected out into space from the 100mm macingun in the Guncannon MPT's right hand and the 90mm machinegun in the left hand.  Then like an emphasis on the sheer firepower being unleashed, the twin 200mm cannons belched in unison.  Carter was gambling on his officer going after the sniper.  Snipers afterall are most vulnerable when they are seen.
<br><br>
As for Kruez, he twisted the Ballistic Sniper Rifle around.  The GM Sniper II rocks from multiple paint ball impacts but the sniper pilot managed to get off a shot that came close enough to the Guncannon MPT to make Carter flinch.  That left an opening for Foley to vent his frustation at the Guncannon MPT.
<br><br>
Pink streaks of beam energy scorched the paintjob of the evading Guncannon MPT, as Carter tried to get in the clear so he can forcus his firepower.  Suddenly, another shot whizzes by him.  Kruez pulls the bolt on his ballistic sniper rifle as he lined up another shot.  He got a pair of 200mm shells sent his way for his trouble, one of them splattering the GM Sniper II's left foot.  AMBAC control went out of whack for a moment, annoying the heck out of Kruez. Things got worse as Carter brought to bear all of his weapons on the spinning sniper mobile suit.
<br><br>
Seeing the GM Sniper II momentarily hapless, Carter readied another salvo only to see a small device float in front of the Guncannon MPT.  His world became painfully white as the flashbang exploded, overloading the mobile suit's optics.  Foley came rushing down on the stunned mobile suit with his beam gun screaming.  The British officer planned ahead and had brought three of these special munitions with him.
<br><br>
But then, Carter picked a simple solution to his problem.  Pulling the triggers on his weapons, the Guncannon MPT began firing at Foley's general direction.  The GM Command's shield changed colors every half a second, but a 200mm round splattered the entire left forearm. Then three rounds from the 100mm machinegun covered the beam spray gun, shutting it down as a precaution.
<br><br>
The  GM Command Space collided with the Guncannon MPT, with head vulcans blazing.  This last attack took out Carter's head optics before the GM Command spun away into space.
<br><br>
Inside the Guncannon MPT's cockpit, Carter tried to activate as many auxilary cameras as he can.  All he can get on his main cameras is a lovely shade of pink.  Finally, he got a view of a starfield back on his monitor.  But before he can hunt down Kruez, something struck his mobile suit hard.
<br><br>
Through the zoom lenses of his headset, Kruez took a steady breath and adjusted his aim.  Manually adjusting AMBAC control on the GM Sniper II, Kruez waited for the right moment.  The Ballistic Sniper Rifle let loose another round and another section of the sniper mobile suit turned neon green.  Before long, the Guncannon MPT looked like a lawn in front of someone's house back on Earth.
<br><br>
At the moment, a buzzer sounded and the spar was over.  Though victorious, Kruez now need to drag his two "colorful" companions back to Luna II.
