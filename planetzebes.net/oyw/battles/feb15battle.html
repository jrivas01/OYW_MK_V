<br>
A lone Public class ship moved on a direct intercept course to the Solomon Defense fleet.  Obviously, the crew was suicidal.  They weren't even trying to be sneaky about it.
<br><br>
"What the fuck is that?"  Dozle Zabi demanded, even though by now it was apparent exactly what it was.
<br><br>
"It's a Federation ship, Public class, sir," a young ensign who was lucky enough to get assigned to the Solomon Defense Fleet straight out of training replied.
<br><br>
"I can see that!  Why is it not scattered into a thousand different particles?"  Dozle replied calmly, nodding to the gunnery crew commanders of the <i>Gwamel</i>.   Almost immediately, sizzling stream of mega-particles lanced out and pierced the Public, which just expanded and popped.
<br><br>
"It was a decoy, sir," the same ensign replied in the silence after.
<br><br>
"We've been had, report to all nearby forces that there is chance Federal forces may be in the area."

<br>
The evening sun sinks slowly as a large group of fighters and bombers make their way across the African horizon, surrounding a single Medea. Their long lazy trek along the skies dragged on.
<br><br>
"BEEP."
<br><br>
"BEEP. BEEP."
<br><br>
"BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP...."
<br><br>
"Missouri, this is flight leader. I'm picking up something, advise we launch the Dish for a better look." Jim Irwin called out to the medea behind him, the reply would be less than favorable.
<br><br>
"Negative leader, Dish is in pieces at the moment, scheduled maintenance." The medea signaled back, Jim could clearly see one of the pilots give a shrug as though to say 'don't ask me why they chose to take it apart now.'
<br><br>
Jim took a moment to think on the matter, and it was nearly a moment too long, as machinegun fire peppered the skies around them.
<br><br>
"Missouri pull up! Fly Manta group, I'll keep an eye on the Don Escargots and the medea. Go buy us some time to get out of range!" He shouted as the quartet of Zakus rushed toward them, firing some more shots to try and break their formation. The six Fly Mantas dove as the rest of the planes climbed, their brash young pilots eager to prove themselves against Zeons monster machines. Dodge and weave thought they tried, eventually a bullet struck true and sheared a wing clean off of the lead fighter. The pilot struggled to activate the ejection seat, but the ground rushed up to meet him all too soon.
<br><br> 
The rest of the fighters broke formation and skimmed the surface of the African sands, no place to hide as they maneuvered around for another attack. Fortunately they still had the Zakus outnumbered, and in splitting up they ensured that one plane could not be targeted. As four aircraft wildly streaked across the dunes evading fire, one Fly Manta had pulled up, and was now on a fairly steep dive at the lead Zaku. Finger shaking on the trigger, the pilot had been stripped of his bravado by the death of his comrade, and now his only thought was with vengeance. Simultaneously firing his missiles and pulling a high-G climb, the Fly manta kicked a cloud of sand into the air, obscuring the Zaku from view until the moment it exploded.
<br><br>
"Fly Manta group, this is flight leader, we're in the clear, ditch those Zakus and lets get back on track." Irwin said, hoping this was the only time they'd have to make a trade-off like that on the way to their destination.

<br>
"Bah. I don't understand, what's so special about them Rick Steve's this lady has for Mr. Toast. Hmph." The young female pirate grumbled to herself as she strapped into the cockpit of her 'Cyclops', readying to spar against the newest guest of Captain Riley. The new lady was some research, scientist type person from the Neills; those colony dwellers were weird folks...
<br><br>
"Why does he need her..." She crinkled her nose in disgust as her systems powered up, the light from the screens illuminating her face; her eyes seemed to shine in the dim cockpit. The mechanic gave her a thumbs up and her cockpit door closed as she departed to meet that Scientist lady.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
<center><i>"I'll make love to you~ Like you want me to~"
<br><br>
"And I'll hold you tight. Baby all through the night."
<br><br>
"I'll make love to you~ When you want me to~"
<br><br>
"And... I will not let go, 'til you tell me to~"</i></center>
<br><br>
Nadia hummed along to the song as it played softly in the background of her cockpit as she carefully went over the paperwork of her contract. Pursing her lips and scanning over the lines she circled a few items and wrote a few notes off to the side as everything seemed to be in order for Mr. Riley. Feeling satisfied with her spreadsheet, she tucked the clipbard away and tucked the pen into her hair as she flipped on the systems to her suit. "I guess its time to see what these pirates got. Should prove interesting I s'pose." 
<br><br>
The Zeonic test pilot turned down the music as her monitors lit up with diagnostics of all her systems. Her eyes scanned over them intently, her fingers pushing buttons and flicking switches instinctively as each check met her approval. After a few seconds her lips curled into a smile as she turned the music back up and she moved her suit out for launch.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
<center><i>10 minutes later</i></center>
"What the hell is this?! I thought this was just a test run!" Nadia scowled as her suit rocked form the poorly thrown cracker grenade. She couldn't figure out if the girl was trying to trick her, naive, or just dumb; it didn't matter. The two suits had been pushed apart by the 'accidental' explosion, giving Nadia the opportunity she needed. With a bitter taste still in her mouth she loaded a live clip into her machine gun and with a few quick boosts, she strafed her suit to the left, taking aim and pelting the side of the Pirate's Zaku. 
<br><br>
"Damn skinny Cyclops!" Addie panicked and pulled on the controls, spinning the Zaku I around sporadically. She wasn't going to prove anything to her Captain at this rate, she had to think of something; It wasn't fair. 
<br><br>
"Here ya' go babydoll." Joiner smiled rather sadistically as she drew her Heat Axe, the blade vibrating to life in a dull orangish glow. Not thinking any better of it, the brash young pirate sped towards Nadia, heathawk held out ready to strike. Seeing the attack from a mile away, Nadia easily brought her shield up to block, the heat hawk glancing off the surface, leaving Nadia open for an attack. Not wanting to be too rude, she restrained herself to a kick, nailing the Zaku in the chest. 
<br><br>
Slightly embarassed, and all around stubborn and determined, Addie swung her Zaku's arm out, knocking the Test Type Zaku in the face, sending her backwards. The Zeonic representive was more shocked than anything as her monitor was full of nothing but shield. "Enough with the cheapshots already!"
<br><br> As she recovered and reached for her own heathawk a voice boomed across their comm. channels.
<br><br>
<i>-Enough m'ladies!-
<br><br>
-Well done, th'both o'ya...-</i>
<br><br>
Captain Riley's distinctive voice came across the channel as he commanded them to stop the match. The Captain had seen enough and was more than happy with what he had seen. Both girls were left huffing and puffing as their adrenaline started to wear off. Addie scoffed as she stared across at the Neill's Zaku; why was she so special? 
<br><br>
In her cockpit, Nadia just let out a sigh; what a strange group of people these pirates were.
<br><br>

<br>
North Africa has grown quiet since war exploded upon its ground four months ago.  The sands blew over the wrecks and carnage created by the rampage of war, covering them until they disappear into time.  But off the coast, the fires of war are boiling the Mediterrenean Sea.
<br><br>
The bow of the Himalaya-class <i>Lleu Llaw Gyffess</i> pushed through the waves of the Mediterrenean Sea.  Over a century ago, similar ships like the HMS Ark Royal cruised these waters under the flag of war.  Now, the Earth Federal naval ship does the same.
<br><br>
Leaning over the chain linked railing, Corporal Hirsh Munchek stared blankly out into the horizon.  Seeing Phuong Vet Kha again was nice, even though it was for only for business.  It got his mind of his own personal failures.  At least for a little while.
<br><br>
High above him on the island that is the control tower for the Himalaya-class carrier, a commotion was already starting.
<br><br>
"CONN, this is sonar," squaked a radio," we are reading four sound anomalies approaching us from the North east.  We are getting detection values shortly but I'll wager my stripes on them being mobile suits."
<br><br>
The captain of the <i>Lieu Llaw Gyffes</i> turned to his operations chief. "Launch the Tin Cods and the Don Escargots!  I want buoys dropped before they are inside five kilometers.  Where the hell is Munchek?"
<br><br>
"Down below decks sir.  His mobile suit is still undergoing repairs-"
<br><br>
"If it can still swim, then launch it.  Send his buddies out too."
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
About ten kilometers away from the <i>Lleu Llaw Gyffes</i>, the four Goggs of the "Red Barracudas" sped as fast as they can towards the Himalaya-class ship.
<br><br>
"I don't see any Hillocks," one of the pilots announced.
<br><br>
"If we keep going at high speed, we can avoid their depth charges," concluded another.
<br><br>
"Speaking of depth charges, here we go," advised their leader.
<br><br>
LIke the trained professionals they are, the armored Goggs speed through the numerous splashes.  Some of them were sonar buoys, others where urgently dropped depth charges.
<br><br>
One pilot broke the surface and unleashed a burst of mega particle at the low-flying Don Escargots.  By the time the other Don Escargots zeroed on him, he was back in the water and continued speeding towards the carrier.
<br><br>
They were about to get to the edge of their torpedo range when three massive objects dropped into the water.  The Waterproof Gundam is still missing its left arm and most of its armor plating but the underwater beam rifle is still highly effective as it chips away at a Gogg.
<br><br>
Privat Gajendra Pondicherry huffed as he smoothly jammed he muzzle of his waterproof machine gun into a Gogg's monoeye and lets rip with a full burst.
<br><br>
The remaining two Goggs tried to circle around them but the Federal MS had delayed them long enough for the Don Escargots to boxed them in.  Slowly but surely the wall of depth charges and the weapons fire from Munchek's team squeezed them together until the last of the "Red Barracudas" are eradicated in a giant plume of water.
<br><br>
It took another half an hour until Munchek and his team are retrieved, but soon afterwards the <i>Lleu Llaw Gyffes</i> continued on its way.
<br><br>

<br>
Crossing through the vast continent of Europe, Zeon's Terrestial Assault Fleet "G-force" traverses onward. During the journey, the fleet takes a break, halting temporarily in Finland. Taking advantage of the stop, two soldiers decide to take the time to spar and hone their skill in combat.
<br><br>
1st Lietenant Marko Dresner and Private First Class Bryce Hollerfeit agree to spar until the fleet is ready to disembark to Archangelisk. After a brief salute, both men entered their respective units. Bryce climbed ontop of his Hildolfr and into the cockpit. 
<br><br>
As the gigantic tank rolled out, Bryce contemplated what his actions would be in the next few days. The thought of engaging the 87th integrated worried him for more than one reason. Meanwhile the same thoughts were on Marko's mind. Nothing hit him harder than losing an ally on the battlefield, which was part of why he was respected by his suboordinates. If G-Force was to engage the 87th integrated, there was no doubt Maria or Akane would be put in harms way, but it was his duty to make sure they would survive and he confirmed himself of this, replacing his thoughts of the future with the events of the present.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
As the Berkhalter's hangar bay doors slid open, Marko's Dowadge came hovering out. Both soldiers met off in the distance to avoid paintball shots ruining the paintjobs of G-Force's battleships. 
<br><br>
"Are you ready?" asked Marko
<br><br>
"Yes. Good luck." replied Bryce as he prepared to face his opponent, his hand everready on the trigger of the Hildolfr's main cannon.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Both soldiers instantly accelerated forward, guns blarings. The battlefield became a fluorecent array of colors as paint pellets rocked the earth beneath them. Marko fired his rocket launcher, aiming straight ahead. Bryce forced the tank to a halt, managing to prevent himself from driving into the paint pellet's burst.
<br><br>
Bryce once again accelerated as Marko reloaded his rocket launcher. He retorted with his main cannon once again, only to witness the Dowadge easily dash to the left.The Dowadge was a fierce mobile suit indeed; superior in agility to a Dom, but Bryce could tell his opponent hadn't mastered combat in gravity yet. The Hildolfr was also far from a pushover as Bryce revealed to his superior officer.
<br><br>
Marko came real close to landing a blow on the Hidolfor, but Bryce managed dodge the shot by pulling of an extremely risky stunt. As he charged the
incoming pellet, he reversed the tread on one of the tank's sides, forcing the tank to flip, narrowily avoiding what would have been the winning blow.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
After the ingenious yet borderline suicidal move, Bryce targeted the Dowadge with the main cannon once again. This attack took Marko by surprise as the shot would have severed his Dowadge's left arm. With the remaining arm, Marko retorted, nailing the Hidolfor. Bryce attempted to reduce the damage by blocking the pellet with the manipulator arms, which only ended up splattering the paint around the entirity of the tank.
<br><br>
Marko then hoverered towards Bryce at full speed. As he approached the tank, he fired the beam scattering gun temporarily blindening his opponent. When Bryce's vision returned, he was surprised to the Dowadge above him with the rocket launcher aimed directly downward.
