“Exotic Manila Harbor...” Hirsch said flipping closed a tourists book, he had managed to ingress in a hurry, and in his few minutes of spare time learned a little about his location. His endless study fueled by coffee and insomnia let him know the layout of the town and how it had been changed by the the present military occupation. The Aqua GM managed almost neutral ballast below the surface of the the water, tucked against a small cliff face. Today was another recon-op, and he was in position, but nothing of note was moving along the walls, along the dock or anywhere where he could easily make notes without exposing his position. He was out of range of the still formidable ground forces.

“Tiger 37, repeat- single GM-type west of grid marker 101.” the Dopp flight lead called to his wingman, “Tiger Lead, confirm visual. Turning to make my gun run.” the pair of veteran Dopp pilots peeled out of the pack. “Roger, weapons hot.” The remaining 8 followed.

Hirsch scanned for opportunities to get closer, or snap a quick photo. He'd been in his position for exactly seven minutes when his TCAS system began to ping. “6 miles.” Hirsch muttered. “Bastards are on the ball today, time for me to egress.” One dot became 2, then 8. The GM slipped quietly below the waves. Using his meticulously studied routes, he selected the route which gave him the most cover from above. Above him, the water turned a deadly orange glow from nearly 10 direct missile impacts, then the distinct SLICE SLICE SLICE of machine gun rounds could be heard on his sensitive mic systems.

<br>

Hirsch quietly left the harbor for safer waters.
