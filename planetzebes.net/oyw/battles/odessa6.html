<br>
The ocean slipped behind White Base; blue and friendly became black and distant as the ship passed the searing coast. The Trojan Horse - that was what Zeon had called it, a name hard earned through blood and sweat - seemed to drift above the soil, rocks and sand. The air beneath it corruscated just as the horizon ahead of them blurred like a waterlogged painting. The pigments dripped from the canvas, streaking orange and red on the African turf, outglowing the pale blue sky. 
<br><br>
On the bridge of White Base, Oscar just finished his lunch - a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, saltier than usual. Odd.
<br><br>
"Oh woah, hey, not for nothin', but uh..." Oscar rambled. "Hey, Mister Bright - we got some incomin' bogeys."
<br><br>
"You sure it's not just jelly this time, Oscar?" Bright asked.
<br><br>
"100%." Oscar stalled for a moment. "99%."
<br><br>
"Alright. Sayla, Frau, the pilots should already be at battle stations. Have Gundam and Guncannon launch. Move Guntank to one of the forward catapaults." Bright leaned back in his chair. "I didn't think we'd make a clean break for it...but I guess we'll have to make time for a few diversions."
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Three!" Amuro shouted over the radio - a Magella blew up as the top fighter tried to eject, exploding the escape system along with the main body.
<br><br>
"Hey Amuro, do you mind keeping your voice down? Some people are trying to, you know, not die!" Kai whined. 
<br><br>
"Oh, shut up, Kai," Sayla sighed. "If you died, then we wouldn't have to hear your whining all the time."
<br><br>
Bright didn't stop her.
<br><br>
"Well, EXCUSE ME, princess."
<br><br>
"Kai, shut up," Hayato interjected, shooting down a distant Luggun from White Base's open catapault door. "Really. Just...just shut up. shut up."
<br><br>
They stopped arguing - Kai decided it'd be easier to stay away from any Magella's line of sight if he stopped talking to Hayato and Sayla. 
<br><br>
Amuro's Gundam landed on the ground, its back to an exploding APC as it knelt, before kicking off and firing its boosters. The Gundam reached the peak of its jump, slowly beginning to fall, and Amuro raised the beam rifle, piercing three Dopps before his accelerating descent made it impossible to accurately aim.
<br><br>
White Base's AA fired continuously on the shrinking air force as the Mobile Suits focused on the ground forces. Amuro reached for a beam saber and the white hilt extended in his hand, terminating in a glowing orb of Minovsky particles. He threw the spear, piercing a Magella through the top. He dashed after the spear and ripped it out of the tank, returning the beam saber to its recharge rack and re-equipping his shield as he sighted his next target.
<br><br>
"Nine!" Amuro shouted again, another Magella blowing up. "All that's left...the planes!" Amuro jumped again, in between streams of AA fire from White Base, and took sight of the few remaining aircraft.
<br><br>
"Ten! Eleven!" The Gundam dropped through the air, but Amuro wasn't done. He looked up again, tilting the Gundam's back to the ground and aiming the beam rifle. "Twelve!" A pink beam passed through the bottom of the Luggun and out the top, dissipating into the atmosphere high above.
<br><br>
"Is that all of them?" Kai asked. "I need a fucking nap."

<br>
Lieutenant Ferdinand drew a lazy circle in the air with his finger, pushing the air forward - just the opposite of what the  signal meant for the EF air forces were to do. The fighters and bombers cut through the atmosphere, injecting air into their engines and blasting it out the rear. 
<br><br>
Scott Archer and Jim Irwin broke away from the ambling Medea, drawing New York away from the horizon and towards themselves. Pinpricks of black dotted the sky and grew exponentially faster than the distant structures of the New York facilities. Zeon fighters and bombers they were - a force to be reckoned with, regardless of your side's power.
<br><br>
Jim Irwin's voice came through the radio - a static crackling for a moment, before molding into slightly distorted words. "...Just don't die," the voice spoke. Almost a lonely request, a statement instead of orders. Simple instructions, though, addressed to every green and vet pilot alike shaking in his seat. Scott's teeth clenched just slightly for only a moment, the sound of a shattering bottle-maybe a scream-resounding in his memory's ear at the word "die."
<br><br>
He would try not to.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The grey sky turned black; weather and detonated aircraft working in conjunction to make the Earth look like a lost ball in an ashen snowglobe.
<br><br>
Missiles streaked past each other in a scramble to reach their targets - targets maneuvering to avoid the projectiles all at the same time. A Dopp fired a missile, only for it and its intended munition to be blown up as a jet core booster's volley of missiles chanced to strike the Dopp in the dense confusion above New York.
<br><br>
Jim Irwin's Tin Cod rolled away, releasing missiles as it tumbled to dodge past a Dopp. The Dopp exploded, unable to dodge at such a close range. Irwin peered through the flight helmet and out the canopy at the freshest black cloud, dissipating into the aether as it shrunk out of his vision.
<br><br>
Scott grasped the throttle and grimmaced as he accelerated, maneuvering the aircraft's thrust vectoring nozzles around with his feet. The massive fighter twirled around a drab green Zeon fighter, slowing as he came around its underside, and as the Dopp pulled ahead, Scott fired the linked machine guns in the core booster's nose. The Dopp's shredded corpse didn't explode, but instead began losing altitude, spinning as it went down - and by some strange coincidence, it fell atop a tin cod. The Dopp rolled off and returned to falling, and the tin cod began slowly arcing downwards towards the Earth.
<br><br>
The Dopp crashed through a tall building in the nigh abandoned city, streaking into the top floor on one side and re-emerging on the other several stories below before slamming into another building and coming to a screeching halt. The tin cod crashed into the asphalt canal flowing between blocks, throwing up sparks before the jet fuel ignited, shattering nearby windows and immolating the airframe.
<br><br>
The battle continued. It seemed that for every two Zeon fighters shot down, a Federation pilot exploded or plummeted to the Earth. Losses on both sides were quickly counting upwards - a tally counted by ruined towers and streets by the city below. Anti-air weaponry was launched from the Zeon base proper, anti-aircraft guns, surface-to-air missiles, and mega particle cannons causing nearly as many casualties as fighters were - on both sides.
<br><br>
Nearly an hour had passed, and the Zeon forces remaining were like the streaks stuck on the inside of an empty mayonnaise jar - useless and grossly distasteful. Federation ground forces held outside of the battlefield, waiting for their airborne allies to sweep the skies clean.
<br><br>
Scott neatly avoided a missile by making a rapid vertical climb and dropping downward as the missile began to lose stability. It blew up high in the atmosphere, safely above most other aircraft. Irwin streaked over the city upside down in a lazy arc, canopy facing the ground, trying to grasp the shape of he battle. There - one of the last remaining Dopps, difficult to spot amongst the pillars of black smoke filling the airspace. 
<br><br>
Two missiles escaped from his fighter and chased after the solitary Dopp and collided before the Zeon pilot could evade. Jim rolled over and checked the battle's status. 
<br><br>
"Anyone reading any remaining-bloody SA launchers!-any remaining bogeys?"
<br><br>
A chorus of "no sir," "nope," "negatory," and "negative" came the reply.
<br><br>
"Looks like we're all set here, then. Bombers proceed, and it's time to give the cavalry a call. OTF Charlie, Zeta, 42nd? All clear - bombers are making their run. We're heading back."
<br><br>
"Copy, Lieutenant. We got a cozy nook in the hangar with your name on it."
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Under fire by the Federation forces, New York's remaining glory collapsed into mountains of shattered glass, crumbled concrete, and mangled rebar. The base was doing all it could to defend itself - effective anti-missile systems were far and few between, and there was nothing they could do about long range cannon rounds. The bombing runs had crippled their static defenses, leaving only a few guns and cannons functional.
<br><br>
A Gaw trapped on the ground at El Gordia airpot had its wings clipped as its wing was shredded and ignited by incoming fire. As it burned, two Gaws rolled down the runways, attempting to take off and escape the storm before all of their forces were cornered. The first Gaw's wheels lifted off the ground and tilted upwards in a desperate gamble to outpace the Federation's barrage. The small window of opportunity that they had tried to take advantage of slammed shut on the Gaw. 
<br><br>
It crashed into the ground, burning. The other Gaw was already climbing up, past the runway, unable to attempt to land. Its hull was torn asunder by missiles and guns, and the ocean welcomed it in a chilly embrace.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The Medea's hangar opened, and the darkened sky seemed to pour in. Pairs of GMs stood in line facing the opening, heavy parachute packs equipped. The red light next to the open door turned yellow. The front two GMs readied themselves. The yellow light turned green.
<br><br>
The first pair of GMs dropped out of the Medea, tracer rounds already wildly streaking past from the ground. Their HALO drop protocol meant that they were still falling, nearly at terminal velocity, when the next pair of GMs dropped out. The first pair opened their parachutes as the third pair dropped out, a tightly interlocked pattern becoming apparent as they continued to jump.
<br><br>
Zeon MS on the ground fired up into the stream of blossoming chutes. Rounds shredded the fabric, causing a handful of MS to plummet towards the ground, thrusters mostly useless to slow their descent. A GM's parachute maintained stability, but it quickly accelerated towards the ground, gliding into a building. The GM slammed through the glass, smashing up against the structural supports of the building before the tower's top floors tore themselves apart and fell with the GM to the ground, crushing the MS under its weight.
<br><br>
Other MS simply crashed into the pavement below, but most of the paradropping forces landed and ejected their parachute kits, and immediately dashed for cover from carefully advancing Zakus.
<br><br>
Arianna's land combat GM variant advanced from the outskirts of the city, taking out a smattering of Zeon MS with her railcannon as she moved from building to building. A Zaku stepped heavily around a corner - right next to her GM. She grimmaced and drew a beam saber. 
<br><br>
"Ggh... good thing you didn't see me." 
<br><br>
The Zaku fell on its face, and Arianna advanced once again, catching occasional glimpses of other MS forces and MS teams.
<br><br>
Aurem ran a finger down his recently acquired scar. It still felt strange. His fingers drifted from the scar and back to the Sniper's controls. His position gave him a small advantage, he had a good line of sight, but it was greatly limited by all the buildings. Fortunately, that meant no Zaku could see him unless he could see them. He glanced down the street in front of him through his rifle's scope. No MS, and there was no sign of a renewed attempt to get in the air from Zeon - <i>Ahhhh... there's a Gaw.</i>
<br><br>
A Gaw appeared over the city's skyline. <i>Just what I was waiting for.</i> The Sniper's rifle slowly moved as Aurem adjusted his gun my millionths of a degree.
<br><br>
"There." He pulled the trigger and put a pink lance through the Gaw's belly. The strange aircraft bled smoke and began losing altitude slowly, doomed to crash somewhere on the city's outskirts.
<br><br>
"Next."
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Noelle's Dom skated around another corner, 90mm rounds glancing off her armor meeting her on the new street. Her Dom sped up and activated the scattering beam gun, blinding the lone GM pilot for just long enough. 
<br><br>
"Bad luck, Feddie." Noelle frowned as she drove the dull heat saber through the GM's torso. The GM slid off the rod as she retracted it and fell to the ground. Noelle bit down on her lip as she decided which way to go next.
<br><br>
On the aquatic front, a handful of Federation marine Mobile Suits cornered the Zeon MSM attempting to attack their ships. A pair of Goggs fired torpedoes at a group of ships, sinking one of them and damaging another as the waterproof Gundam arrived. Hirsch brought his anchor launcher to bear and crushed one of the Gogg's faces before finishing it off with a torpedo shot. 
<br><br>
"Mama, I'm going to make sure New York is free Nazis, like it should be." He laughed nervously for a moment. "Come on, Gundam. Work with me here. You sound like you've got a fried gearbox." 
<br><br>
Charles Gano caught up to the waterpoof Gundam and launched his twin anchors at the other Gogg, catching it on the arm and jerking it aside as he launched a torpedo into its body.
<br><br>
"Hirsch - are you okay?" The Gundam looked strange.
<br><br>
"I'll be fine, the Gundam's just not taking it well."
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
<i>She's here.</i>
<br><br>
"Wass that, lass? Ye talkin' about that other canned faery?"
<br><br>
<i>I want to save her, Thorvald.</i>
<br><br>
"Wall thas all fine and good, but we've got a wee predicament here."
<br><br>
The Blue Destiny jumped backwards, just out of the way of a gigantic Heat Hawk. It was a strange looking Zaku - might of well have been Nidhogg itself's Zaku. The blades on the forearms looked mean, but Thorvald had no intention of trying to find out. Marion was acting oddly, at least as far as she went.
<br><br>
<i>She's... she's really close now... she's here!</i>
<br><br>
A strange dark-purple MS appeared atop a building to the Blue Destiny's left. 
<br><br>
"O' course. B'cause I was doing so waell b'fore."
<br><br>
The Efreet jumped down and fired its shotgun at the Blue Destiny, which raised its shield just in time. 
<br><br>
<i>Save her, Thorvald!</i>
<br><br>
"No promises, lass."
<br><br>
The Shin Zaku II pried its tomohawk out of the pavement and greeted Nimbus Schutze.
<br><br>
"Lieutenant Shoji - can we finish this up? Quickly."
<br><br>
"Heh. Sure thing, Nimbus!" Shoji grinned like a moron.
<br><br>
"...Let's just get this over with."
<br><br>
The Blue Destiny took cover behind a building, but it quickly found a tomohawk buried in the corner of the building at head height. It dove out from behind the cover and fired at the Shin Zaku, blowing off the outer armor on its forearm along with the blades. 
<br><br>
Shoji's jaw dropped. "Alrlrlrlrlrlright then... TOMOHORK BOOMERANG?" He didn't sound as confident as usual, understandable given the general circumstances. The tomohawk slammed into the Blue Destiny, but Thorvald maneuvered out of the way just in time, only suffering a glancing blow. Lieutenant Shoji retried, quickly swing the giant weapon to one side and back, batting the Blue Destiny with the flat of the axe.
<br><br>
"Orf!" The blue MS slammed into a building and fell down. The impact crushed the Destiny's chest armor, deforming the cockpit hatch and shattering one of the cockpit screens. Thorvald was knocked unconscious and bleeding from control panel shards buring themselves in his body. 
<br><br>
<i>Thorvald... Thorvald... Thorvald... ThorvaldthorvaldthorvaldthorvaldthorvaldnotagainnotagainIdon'twantthispleasewakeup!</i> Marion's cry became desperate and shrill, but it didn't do any good to wake up the unconscious man.
<br><br>
<i>Not again..! I won't let it happen any more!</i>
<br><br>
The cockpit filled with red, and the Blue Destiny's eyes changed to a matching crimson.
<br><br>
Ando Shoji stood over the fallen GM, not quite sure if he was comfortable with killing a man who was down. He had to - his sense of honor told him he had to, even if it felt wrong, to protect his men, and to save the base. This MS was just too dangerous.
<br><br>
But he was too slow in making up his mind. The Destiny jerked up and decapitated the Shin Zaku II with its shield, dropping the bazooka in its other hand at the same time. The Shin Zaku II fell to the ground, and the Blue Destiny's thrusters fired in unison at full power. Sparks flew as it scraped along the ground, almost skating, towards the Efreet. 
<br><br>
"What the..!" The Efreet's EXAM system activated as the dashing Blue Destiny approached, and tore control away from Nimbus. "Not now! Listen to me!"
<br><br>
<i>I won't let you hurt him any more!</i> Marion screamed at the Efreet as they collided. The Efreet was caught by the Destiny's momentum, and they both continued boosting down the street. 
<br><br>
<i>You don't have to fight any more... I'll save you...</i>
<br><br>
The Mobile Suits' faces were pressed up against one another, and as the Blue Destiny's vulcan's fired, the red light in the Efreet's visor dulled. Marion was crying. The Blue Destiny's chest-mounted missiles fired, and the Efreet slammed into a building at the end of the street as the Federation MS pulled away. The explosion knocked the BD even further away, and tore the Efreet apart.
<br><br>
The remaining bits of the Efreet were spread in a building as though it had sat down. Oil flowed like blood from its torso. 
And blood dripped like oil from the chest.

<br><br>
It was a cloudy day in central China, as rainstorm after rainstorm made the Odessa Task Forces Echo and Foxtrot struggle on their approach to Lhasa through the Tanggula Mountain range. They had stayed relatively close to the Lhasa river as the terrain was easier to traverse. The rain storms came to a temporary halt as both forces gathered at their destination The infamous Kojima battalion was eager to begin their assault by land and Nguen Vao Kai's Medeas flew overhead. The temporary stop to the rainstorms brought a good opportunity to strike, but also a mist that hovered over the base of the mountains that surrounded Lhasa.

<br><br>
A dish flew overhead, relaying tactical information to the fleets, which helped Kojima coordinate where to place his forces. The Type 74 and 61 tanks were the first to roll out, as better data was needed. The dish’s intel was lacking due to the weather conditions preventing the unit to obtain better information on Zeon’s layout. The GM Snipers and Guntanks were the next to move into position.
<br><br>
From Chittagong’s port, the Lhotse and Pasture got in position to bombard the underground mountain base from the safety of sea. Both naval vessels 
<br><br>
"Inform Kojima that we the bombardment will commence soon." ordered Nguen Vao Kai, as he sat on the captain's seat, overlooking the Himalaya. “Also prepare to launch fighters and bombers, the Kojima battalion will need air-support.”
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Meanwhile in Lhasa, a shocking discovery was made at the listening post. 
<br><br>
"Lord Sahalin! we have intercepted Federation transmission. They have begun preparations for an assault. We have already sent out a Laggun to confirm this, and they did right before we lost contact." inf.ormed the listening post's communications officer
<br><br>
"Then why are you bothering me? Inform Packard and Oberscharfuhrer Adeline to prepare a counter attack." ordered Ghinius.
<br><br>
"We can't find him. He disappeared shortly after we informed him." replied the communications officer.
<br><br>
"Look harder." Ghinius grimly replied. "Until you find him, have Adeline lead the counter-attack. If you bother me again with news that you can not locate him, I will have your head. Do I make myself clear?"
<br><br>
"Yes, Sir." replied the communications officer, quite nervous now. A safe distance away he muttered "Don’t shoot the messenger…jeez."
<br><br>
Ghinius continued to his sister, Aina’s quarters where he overheard talk.
<br><br>
"My lady, I regret to inform you that news has reached us of your acquaintance Shiro’s death. The 08th MS was engaged last week and there were none survivors. I’m eternally sorry, my lady." said Norris, with the grief reflecting of his face.
<br><br>
As the words echoed in her heads, tears slid down from her cheek.
<br><br>
"I have sworn to protect you, my lady, and I have sworn to protect your happiness, but I have failed." he continued.
<br><br>
"No…Norris…you have been…too…kind to me…over the years. This…is not…your fault." she replied amidst the crying.
<br><br>
"Your kindness knows no bounds, my lady. You have seen enough sorrow, I ask you to leave with your brother when the time comes." requested Norris.
<br><br>
"Yes, of course." she replied, lying, knowing fully her next task. The one true man she had loved in the world, and was the only hope she had for a bright future had been killed, and her world shattered from the grief.
<br><br>
"Packard, shouldn’t be preparing for the attack? Or does the Principality of Zeon pay you to talk?" rhetorically asked Ghinius, smug as ever.
<br><br>
"Yes, of course, sir!" replied Packard as he saluted his superior officer. The amount of times Norris wanted to sock him straight in the face, was immeasurable. He did what he was told, just like the other times, and made his way to the hangars to launch.
<br><br>
Ghinius then turned to his sister, greeting her only with a backhand. "I grow weary of your little infatuation with the enemy. Now report to the Kergeren, and I do not want to hear another word of this matter."
<br><br>
As Norris made it to the hangars, the entire base shook as if the mountain was to come crashing down. It was official that the assault had begun.
<br><br>
"We will need someone to replace Lady Aina in her High Mobility Type." announced Norris ad he made his presence known.
<br><br>
"I'll handle it, sir. I know the suit like the back of my head as I have worked on its repairs." came a voice from the Chief Mechanic Kenji.
<br><br>
"Very well, I appreciate this Chief." replied Norris. "Now, prepare for launch. The Federation Ground forces should be advancing once the bombardment comes to a halt."
<br><br>
"It isn’t like you, Norris, to be tardy." commented Adeline as she noticed him 
<br><br>
"Worried you would need my help?" he asked.
<br><br>
"Heh, whatever." she replied, brushing off his meaningless retort.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Meanwhile overhead, hordes of fighters had escorted bombers to the base, protecting them from Anti-Aircraft fire, Gunship Helis, and Dopps. The Bizet, Heinekin, and Amstel, all had begun para-dropping GMs, while GM Ground types began their advance on the ground. The overwhelming aerial assault was enough to blott out what little sunlight that penetrated the grey clouds. The Perry and Hoverer soon assisted all their advancing forces, covering them with mega particle cannon fire. All type 61s and mass-produced Guntanks, provided additional artillery fire.
<br><br>
Magellas and Zaku Cannons held the line, keeping the Federation from breaking through just long enough for Norris and Adeline to lead reinforcements in the counterattack. Things looked grim for Zeon thus far. but they had managed to draw in the enemy closer, preventing interruption from artillery, due to the chances of friendly fire. At this range, their advantage of mobile suit numbers would be most beneficial.
<br><br>
On the ground, Adeline charged on  ferociously, firing her gatling gun repeatedly to subdue enemies in her path with four Doms at her side. The Dom pilots made quick use of their scattering beam guns, blinding GM pilots, and making them easy targets. Adeline was still not fully adapted to her new Gouf, but her newtype awareness made getting used to it a lot easier. As her bullets tore holes into a GM’s limbs and skull, she used her heat  sword to stab into its cockpit, and lifting it off the ground, allowing it to act as a large shield to ward off beam rifle and cannon fire.
<br><br>
"Get out of my way feddie scum!" she shouted in the midst of her blood thirst.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Meanwhile Norris had lead four Zaku II J Types in Dodai YS units, as well a squad of three Gouf flight types to pursue the invading aircrafts. Time and time again, the Escargots would carpet bomb the area, making it difficult to attack back.
<br><br>
"As long as we are overwhelmed by an Aerial assault, there is no chance for success." informed  Norris, after taking a few moments to survey the battlefield.
<br><br>
Balls of fire came crashing down, as Norris began slaughtering the inexperienced Jet Core Booster pilots with Gatling fire and his Dodai YS' missile launcher. As a Tin Cod approached too close, Norris grappled it with his Heat Rod and flung it at the Bizet, causing quite a bit of damage and allowed him to approach without being gunned down. The Dodai YS shifted to the side and Norris loaded bullets into the Medea’s engines, causing it to crash into the ground.
<br><br>
The sight of the Medea’s fall both boosted Zeon morale and forced the two remaining medeas to retreat.  Norris continued swatting aircrafts like flies, aided by Gatling and Zaku machinegun fire from his allies. A couple of the Zakus were already picked off from groups of Tin Cods and Jet Core Booster that seeked to eliminate the lesser threats first. The Dodai YS units they were mounted on, were easy targets to focus on as their destruction would mean their riders would be pulled back down to earth by the bitch named gravity. The Zaku ground types caught themselves and slowed their fall with their Earth adjusted thrusters.
<br><br>
"Damn it! There's just too many!" cursed Norris. "No matter."
<br><br>
As Norris cut through a flying manta with his sword, his Dodai YS was sniped from GM Snipers. Quickly reacting he pushed on his thrusters, allowing him to land on a Don Escargot that soon crashed due to the weight. 
<br><br>
"Adeline, take care of those snipers. They are seeking refuge in the city itself." ordered Norris, who shot another Flying manta down as he hovered over it. 
<br><br>
Norris then shifted his attention to another one ahead, which he stabbed his sword through, from underneath the unit, transforming his sword into a shishkabob stick. A Jet Core Booster managed to best him temporarily by destroying his Gouf custom's shield with an anti-mobile suit missile. Norris replied instantly with several rounds from his 3 -barrel 35mm machine gun. Norris realized he would be an easy target as he was out in the open, so he grappled onto a Don Escargot and hung from underneath it. As the Escargot neared the ground, Norris slammed it using the Gouf's strength.

<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Adeline approached the location the GM Snipers were huddled at, but she had to pass through a Guntank that blocked her progression. It opened fire on her with their hand mounted vulcans, which she effortlessly blocked with the Gouf custom's shield. She danced around the vulcans until the clip was empty, and the federation pilot cursed for the very last time. She tackled the Guntank into an abandoned building, most brutally, firing the her gatling gun straight into the cockpit.
<br><br>
"Die you bastard!" she shouted, as flames from the explosion enveloped her suit, darkening the Gouf custom's paint job with burn marks.

Adeline continued onward, with only a couple Doms remaining, as they were disbursed by stray GM Ground types. As she approached a GM Sniper, she quickly withdrew her sword and stabbed the unit in the back, before the pilot could even react to get up, A combination of blood and oil splashed her Gouf.

"Hold your ground! Target all air-crafts. I will engage incoming mobile suits with Privates Johnson and Takuya" ordered Norris, who then followed Adeline's trail of destruction with the two Zaku II Land types.
<br><br>
"Hmmphh…cannon fodder!" yelled Norris as he broke through a line of Type 61 tanks with ease. 
<br><br>
A type 74 then released a smoke grenade to inform command of the enemy's location. Gundam mass produced types adjusted their destination to intercept.

Adeline on the other hand was struggling, as she was ambushed by another squad of GM Ground types while she was distracted by another Guntank. The GMs’ machinegun and bazooka fire kept her at bay, and she retaliated with her barrel machinegun fire. She had tried her best to evade, but her reaction time was not in sync with her mobile suit. She wasn’t reacting fast enough or at times too fast, for she was still used to her previous mobile suit. After managing to disable one of the GM Ground types, the remaining two flanked her, and impaled her Gouf custom with their beam sabers. In her last efforts, she punched into one of the GM’s cockpits, crushing the pilot. With her other arm, she held onto the other GM, hoping the blast from her Gouf would take it out,
<br><br>
The Gouf sparked up and critical warnings lit up the main screen. Rose Adeline muttered her last words which were "…I…failed...you…Sardo." As she waited for  Death’s embrace, she reminisced about her life; her time spent at the Flannigan institute and her forging into the respected officer that she was.
<br><br>
From a distance, Norris witnessed Rose's death. He cursed as he could not make it in time. His anger fueled him to push himself even harder. He had made this far on blowing off steam from the disappointment of seeing Aina’s tears. Norris ran forward at full speed and then proceeded to ram the remaining GM Ground type with his sword into a rashed building.
<br><br>
"I have avenged you Rose…may you find pea.." he whispered, but was interrupted by a squad of Gundam mass produced types.
<br><br>

<br>
The two Zakus that had followed him, provided cover fire, while Norris jumped to face them, displaying his fearless nature. Norris jumped over the first Gundam, landing on its head, then jumping back and sidekicking the adjacent Gundam in the chest with the Gouf's right leg. With the Gouf's left arm, Norris fires his barrel machinegun into the Gundam on his left side. With the right hand, he reaches for his heat saber with the heat wire, before touching the ground. As the wire retracts, Norris crosscuts the Gundam right ahead of him, severing its limbs. Before the second strike could be delivered, a shot from a GM Sniper's rifle severs the Gouf's arm. The Gundam infront of him, kicks the Gouf over and then proceeds to fire its machinegun into the chest for a complete round.
<br><br>
with the loss of Packard, Adeline, and over half of the forces, the order for the Kergeren’s retreat is given. Everyone else was ordered to martyr themselves for the Zeon cause, and so the Zanzibar could make its retreat. From her assigned quarters aboard the ship, Aina watches the battle’s final moments and what appears to be the destruction of Norris' Gouf. Tears continue to drip down as she had just lost the only other person in this world that cared for her. Her own brother treated her with no respect, which was extremely painful for any sister. She reached into her pocket and took out a cyanide pill, swallowing it instantly. In a matter of seconds, her body hits the ground. Over Lhasa, the rain begins to pick up again as the Federation begin to celebrate their victory while also morning their many losses.
