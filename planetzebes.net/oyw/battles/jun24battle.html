Aurem was still distraught, filled with agony and grief over what had happened to Arieta. Nigel had to practically drag him out of her section of the infirmary just so he could get his own medical treatment, and afterwords he had done little but try to be with her. Her condition was still critical, and it had yet to be seen whether or not she would be okay.
<br><br>
By now, Aurem was a distinguished ace of the war. He'd shot down an untold number of Zeon battleships, protected Revil at Odessa, killed Garma, he was possibly the single most decorated war hero of the entire Federation military. But none of that mattered to him. All that mattered to him was Arieta, and whether or not she would be okay. He kept going through things in his mind, over and over, replaying the events of the last few months. Had he waited too long to say what he really felt? Would he never get a chance to be with her again? What would she do if it had been him on the operating table instead?
<br><br>
While these questions dogged Aurem day by day, they were of no concern to the Federation brass, who were considering an entirely different matter. Only one day after the battle, while he was sitting at the hospital, waiting outside Ariannas room, a page came up to him and quietly deposited a folder in his lap.
<br><br>
He opened it, looking at the technical specifics for a new model of Federation mobile suit, the FA-78-2 Heavy Gundam.
