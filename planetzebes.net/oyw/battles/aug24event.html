<br>

After the fourth and largest piece of Island Iffish collided with Australia, an impact winter began that drastically altered the climate across the globe. The rumors that circulated in the first weeks after the impact were the worst. No one really knew what to expect on either side. Some thought that it was a deathblow for the Earth and that the planet would never be able to recover.

<br><br>

From their vantage points on this day, they found it hard to believe that they had ever been so foolish. The Medea-class “Alaska” was accompanied by two Don Escargot as it trekked along the Chilean coast. Their mission was clear: find and delay the last known Zeonic fleet on planet Earth. If they could pull it off then they would be hailed as heroes. If not then their names would be carved onto a memorial somewhere.

<br><br>

The quarry, however, was far from blind. A single speedboat was waiting in the distance. It picked up their signal using its advanced sensors and before long the hunted fleet was making preparations for combat. With their task completed, the Sealance idled and observed.

<br><br>

They had quite the sight. The sun was beginning to set, and thanks to Island Iffish, it was beautiful. All sorts of dazzling colors were reflected in the water from the vibrant sky. For the briefest of moments, Federation and Zeonic eyes alike were lost in the beautiful imagery.

<br><br>
One missile volley from the Pendragon later and the Sealance’s crew were the only ones watching.
