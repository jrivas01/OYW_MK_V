<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>ZEF Primus Takes On Purebread</b></font></center>
<br>
The Zeon Expeditionary Force. Heroes of the Principality, one of the most well respected and feared fleets in the entirety of the Earth Sphere. What was once a great fleet has split itself into several microgroups, each tasked with various objectives, all under the great leadership of the good looking, especially in a miniskirt, Brigadier General Veronica Wu.
<br>
Primus Group, specifically assigned under the command of Commodore Clancy Breen, the uncouth and well-meaning SAF commander, from the bridge of the Musai-class <i>Vigilance</i> looks out into the space that is Side 3. His orders had been handed down directly from the famous General, and the objective was clear. Even in the wake of the defeat at Solomon, they still had a job to do. Federation reinforcements had been rumored to be passing through the area, and he was on mop-up duty. His ship, flanked by the Chivvay Admiral-class <i>Vasa</i> and Scout Musai-class <i>Spearhead</i> were on high alert.
<br>
Aboard the Salamis-class <i>Purebred</i>, the bridge crew was nervous. They were a ship commanded from the words of the feared Evander Creed. They were disciplined, decked out in the dark blue uniforms handed out upon their commissioning, as part of a new look for a special forces unit within the Federation, but they were still green. And they were deep within enemy territory. A false move, and they could be descended upon by the great cycloptic monsters that were the feared Zeon mobile suits. The comm officer, his hand over an earpiece, leaned closely to his monitor. His face went shock white as he turned to face the captain.
<br>
"Sir! Enemy contacts detected! Possible Zeon mobile suits in bound!" Upon hearing those words, the Captain stepped into action. His hand outstretched as he barked out orders. "Broadcast Minovsky Particles, launch the GMs! Have them cover our escape! We have to meet up with the Grand Fleet!"
<br>
Persephone Dawn, rumored to be one of the Zeon Forces legendary Newtypes, stretched out with her mind, as her Zaku-II  Manipulator Type led the MS forces out into battle. She could feel the building pressure of various life-forms moving around them, moving towards their position, while others started moving away. Each arm of the Zaku was equipped with the ubiquitous machine gun, ready for an attack from any angle. She took off as soon as the first bristles of light from the enemy Salamis started arcing out towards them. The response from the fleet was immediate, as blasts of light and missiles began tracking their target. She moved quickly, her Zaku maneuvering between blasts, far faster than any normal pilot could.
<br>
Anya Wilds, finally sure of herself in her Gelgoog, followed behind her fellow MAF pilot, the Beam Rifle trained on the incoming enemy GMs. They had a specific job, protect their ships, and try to take out the enemy vessel. She kept her visuals up, watching for any possible attack from any direction. While maybe not as "gifted" as Dawn, she certainly was no slouch. Her concentration was broken, however, when a flash of red sped past her.
<br>
The Val Varo was a mobile armor designed for a specific purpose. Unlike the older brother "Bigro", the Val Varo is an anti-mobile suit demon. Bristling with numerous beam weapons and the feared "plasma leader" it's designed to take out as many enemy mobile suits as possible. Felix found himself smiling widely as the mega particle gun lanced out, almost immediately hitting its mark as a Federation GM exploded brilliantly. He could feel the pressure of the G-Forces hitting him as he banked the Val Varo as quickly and tightly as he could, firing the smaller beam guns, tracking the enemy GMs. Persephone Dawn found herself caught between the fire of the Val Varo and two GMs, but her preternatural senses allowed her to dance about, firing several shots from the machine cannons in her arms to hit GMs at odd angles. Bullets managed to impact and ding against the tough Federation shields, but once they found their marks in the "soft" titanium shells of the GMs, the exploded just as brilliantly as if they had been hit by beams.
<br>
Clancy watched from the bridge as the battle unfolded before him, his eyes still trying to have the ships support the MS as much as possible. Several bursts of light warned him of the destruction of mobile suits, but he kept the fleets contingent of Zakus back, having them defend the ships in case the enemy did manage to get through.
<br>
His counterpart aboard the <i>Purebred</i> was just as concerned. CIC was reporting the GMs destroyed, and that an enemy Gelgoog had managed to get through their lines. Beam fire pierced the hull of the ship as it turned about, all the while firing everything it could to keep the enemy MS at bay. He would have to thank who-ever designed the AA batteries, and their fast tracking ability. And the brave pilots of the GMs, who kept the attention of that mobile armor pilot, and bought them the necessary time to try to make their escape. It was only by pure luck that the ship could limp away. She would survive, but she certainly wasn't going to be winning any battles anytime soon.

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>ZEF Secundus takes on Cortez!</b></font></center>
<br>
They were called "The Ship-killers". Some of the most feared units within the Zeon military, and they were gathered under the auspices of the Zeon Expeditionary Force. They were on the hunt for the enemy, and many who served were still red with anger and grief, over the loss of their dear friend and comrade, Emil Myberg.
<br>Richard Banks, the ace pilot of the SAF, and Mobile Suit Commander of the ZEF, stood at the front lines, his Gelgoog Marine Commander type loaded to bear. The high speed and output of the machine was disgustingly powerful, and it truly was a might of the Zeon forces. But even that piece of technology was outclassed by the two gargantuan beings he knew were out there with him. The newly arrived Bigro piloted by Kenshiro Imawano, and the monster known as "Zeong", piloted by Emil's close friend, Florian Cuyler. Banks opened up a quick comm before the Minovsky interference got too bad.
<br>
"Lady and Gentlemen, we've got a job to do. Those Feddies think they're going to get away with what they did. They're wrong. Let's show them why." It was short, simple, and direct. And they all knew the underlying meaning. They were doing this for Emil.
<br>Haifa, the totally female pilot of the stolen GM, stayed near the Bigro, wanting to see the mobile armor in action from the best vantage point. She smiled as she watched the Zeon forces begin to spread, their quarry well within their sights. She was worried that she might get caught in the crossfire once interference went up, but the IFF code seemed to be holding up. Still, you could never really count on technology, since it could still go wrong.
<br>
Florian was quiet, even for him. His mind was racing as he felt the nearby pressure of his compatriots. But at his fingertips, and more importantly, controlled directly by his mind, was one of the most powerful weapons ever created. He simply had to wait for the enemy pressures to arrive, and he would easily destroy them, and turn them to nothing. And it would be sweet, sweet revenge for the death of his friend.
<br>
Kenshiro was still bitter about the lack of socializing within the ZEF, but he still knew his job when it had to happen. He would be the first wave, and once the signal was given, the Bigro took off as fast as it could. The metal claw-arms of the AMBAC system helped maneuver the massive Mobile Armor as he went headlong for the enemy Salamis. They had already launched their GMs, hearing of the attack of a fellow Salamis in the same sector, they were already on guard. But the GMs were no match for what happened next. The Bigro just ignored them as the Zeong had followed closely behind. Two of the GMs were immediately extinguished as the remote-arms of the Zeong ran through their torsos, the fixed beam sabers igniting through the reactors. Florian smirked as he toyed with the enemy. They were nothing to him.
<br>
Richard and Haifa were tangling with a GM a piece, their mobile weapons, one the stolen technology of the Federation, and the other a souped up Zeon warmachine, tore through the enemy GMs, beam sabers moving as quickly as the eye could see. Haifa laughed as she turned her GM, tracking the last remaining GM and taking it out from a clean shot from her machinegun.
<br>
The Captain of the <i>Cortez</i> watched in horror as his MS team was dispatched with what seemed to be barely any effect on the enemy, despite the volleys of beam spray guns and machine weaponry before they were lost from the CIC screen. It was then that he saw it. The mono-eye of the Bigro coming headlong for the bridge, his eyes going wide as the mono-eye flashed pink, and the beak of the mobile armor opened, revealing the ship-crippling mega particle cannon. The AA guns were tracking on the Bigro, but they were also busy dealing with the Gelgoog Marine Commander, GM, and Zeong, and they had no chance to get a clear firing arc on the mobile armor.
<br>
The last thing the Captain saw was the blast erupt from the mouth of the Bigro, blowing away the bridge. He didn't get to see the claw-arms of the Bigro literally break the Salamis in twain, and the ensuing explosion that surrendered the Salamis to the sea of stars.

<br>
In the coastal area of South America, the ships of the 87th Integrated Fleet sit in wait as they are being repaired. Little did they know that the enemy was attempting to retreat. The Jukon II, named Avalon, was terribly damaged in their last attack. They figured that they would escape underwater but due to the damage they suffered this was not possible.  
<br><br> <center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center> 
<br> 
In the conference room of the Avalon, pilots Akira Sasaki, Gilgamos Uruk, and Alec Irusk were going over their escape plan. They would not be able to sortie because their mobile suits had taken damage as well as still not being 100% operational. Their plan hinges on the assumption that the Federal Big Trays wont follow them over the water. It was a gamble but such is war.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
On the bridge of the Avalon the captain of the ship makes a ship wide announcement, “Listen up everybody, we are going to try to escape the federal fleet stationed here, We will wait for the cover of night before we make our escape.” The captain pauses before continuing his speech, “We hope that the Federal Land Battleships wont follow us as they get closer to the water. I know I have asked a lot of you but if this plan works we will be in the clear. That is all.”
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Night came and the captains and most of the crews of the 87th Integrated Fleet were either sleeping or passed out drunk on their bunks, leaving a skeleton crew to watch over the ships radars. The crew aboard the Avalon had waited patiently for the cover of night to make their escape. Everybody on the ship were nervous. As the time came the Avalon started to move out.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The Avalon started to power up its engines, riding on the surface of the water. That's when the radars started pinging on the Federal Big Trays. The officer in charge on the bridge of the Big Sioux decided to launch the Dish to get an idea of where the object was. Once the Dish had transmitted back the data on the position of the object, he signaled the other Big Trays in the fleet to follow suit. 
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
As the Big Trays move towards the coastal edge of South America they notice that it was a enemy Jukon II in their waters. The Jukon was well still in range of the guns of the Big Trays but the Big Trays stop near the edge of the water. The Jukon II was hardly worth the effort to pursue. They let the heavily damaged sub flee. Everybody on the Avalon, including, Akira, Gilgamos, and Alec let out a sigh of relief as they putted away from South America.
