<br>
South Africa, present day, present time. The soldiers of the African Union are still fighting to liberate their beloved country from the Zeon invaders. The plan for this attack was one of range and distance, and this suited Malak Lazarevich just fine because he had his GM Sniper two as well as two guntanks and a dish high in the sky. The operation was simple enough, go in, snipe from a distance, kill the Zeon ace.

<br>
Malak and his team of guntanks and the Dish arrive on the outskirts of the south African border. Little did he know that the patrol he was going after had a listening outpost that detected his approach. Roy Greenwood jumped into his Dom TTT and headed out. The 3 Zaku II D's follow shortly. Roy went over with the three pilots to act like they didn't detect anything and to fake being on a normal patrol.

<br>
Malak layed his GM Sniper II down on its stomach as he lines up the shot in the Dom TTT. Malak was patient enough to wait for the shot and right when he had the a good enough shot he took it. The beam fired out of the long-range beam rifle towards the Zeonic patrol. It was luck on Roy's part that at that second one of the Zakus, unknowingly, walked into the shot. The Zaku II D exploded in a violent manner and Roy sent out his other two Zakus to intercept the attackers.

<br>
The guntanks, with out skipping a beat, started their cannon assaults on the incoming Zaku II D's. The Zakus try to avoid the bombardment but to their dismay they eventually get destroyed. The distraction was a well placed tactic for Roy to escape and to live to fight another day. As the smoke clears all you see were craters from the cannon shellings and scorched earth marks where the mobile suits exploded.
