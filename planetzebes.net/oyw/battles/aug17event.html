<br>
Charles Gano, Edmund Blackadder, Thierry Mersault and Aaron McCaskey once again found themselves loitering on the bridge of one of the Big Trays parked in the now Federation occupied California base.  As usual, they were up to their favorite (writer invented) sport of harrasing people who actually had jobs to do, rather than make themselves useful with repairs, bad RPing, or even drinking.  This time their targets were the requisite female bridge bunnies.
<br><br>
"Hey baby, what's say you and me blow this popsicle stand and get a bite to eat?" Thierry asked a bridge bunny.
<br><br>
"I'd sooner weather another wave of Zeon attacks!" she responded bitterly.
<br><br>
"You may just get your wish,"  McCaskey said somewhat startled by what he himself had seen.
<br><br>
The whole of the bridge pushed and shoved their way over tot he window that McCaskey had been staring out of to see what he was talking about.  Sure enough at the front of a tall collumn of smoke, was a single Dobday class Zeon carrier, apparently hell bent on attacking California base.  It slowed to stop just shy of artillery range to let out it's full compliment of eight Zaku Cannons and some gunship helis, before advancing slightly and opening fire on the EF fleet in concert with its recently deployed MS compliment.
<br><br>
"Looks like somebody missed the memo that the attack was yesterday..."  Blackadder said somewhat sarcastically.
<br><br>
Unfortunately for the Dobday, putting the EF fleet in range for its cannons also put itself in range of the EF's cannons.  The four of five working Big Trays all simultaneously open fire on the Dobday obliterating it in an instant.  Seconds later, shells from the Himalays parked in the port smashed into the wreckage of what used to be a Dobday, reducing any hope of its suvival to practically nil.
<br><br>
The sudden loss of their base so early in their assault stunned the Zaku pilots for a moment, but it didn't take them long to recover and resume their now almost comical bombardment of California base's occupying fleet.  The few Federation mobile suits that managed to scramble in time took a few pot shots from well beyond their range before the Zakus were obliterated by the Big Trays guns.
<br><br>
A swarm of angry Federation tin cods, fly mantas, and other such fighter craft was building behind the fleet, preparing to nuetralize any potential air threat the gunship helis might present.  It seemed the pilots had other plans after witnessing the destruction of their attack force in mere minutes.  All twelve of them turned tail and flew away from the battlefield as fast as their rotor wings could take them.
<br><br>
For the bridge comic relief crew, most of this happened in complete silence with the occasional scream when a shell landed too close to the bridge.  Each of them noticed that they now had a bridge bunny clinging to them in fear of being shelled.  They all silently thanked the ghosts of the Zeon pilots whom they'd just finished vaporizing.
<br><br>
Gano broke the silence, "So... who wants lunch?"
