Olivia Baklitskaia had spent much of the day educating her new comrades in the Zeon Expeditionary Force as to the correct pronunciation of her name, trying to stem the tide of "Olive," "Back-lit" and the favorites, "Officer" and "Ma'am." Despite her firm protests, careful explanations, and attractive figure, most men had been unable to get their brains past her boobs, and most women had walked off in a huff - not that she minded, really; she enjoyed the attention. The Crimson Flasher, as she was trying to become known, was running into difficulties. For now, she trotted off to her Rick Dom II, hoping to catch a few more men's eyes on the way.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The Zeon's new petty officer's troubles were nothing, compared to those of the EF commander, Patrick Foley. As he had expected, the Zeon Expeditionary force was retaliating for the recent destruction of the Conscon fleet, in full force. The Federation fleet hadn't quite finished repairing yet, though the mechanics were working overtime, again. Alex Sentara and Derek Carter were in the hangar almost constantly, supervising repairs on their respective machines, and helping out where they could.
<br><br>
Word on the street was that there would be another battle soon, and they wanted to be ready. Derek Carter felt a personal responsibility for his machine, and the people it could protect. No one would die on his watch, if he had any say about it. He fished another tangle of fried electronics from his Guncannon MPT and began troubleshooting the exposed wires as he thought of his commander's plan for the coming offensive.
<br><br>
Jack Murphey and Cassandra Elaine Beckett had hit it off pretty well, strangely enough, and were on the floor of the hangar as well, sharing their experiences with their new positions in space. Both were new to the EFSF, and both had interesting stories to tell about their life on earth, which they weren't particularly eager to share. Cassandra had seen the old, wheelchair-bound man sitting alone, and made an effort to get to know him. Murphey hadn't minded much; the girl reminded him a little bit of his ex-wife, and it was good to talk to a fellow ground-pounder.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Zeon's forces were also feeling brotherhood, but they were considerably less-threatened. Their commander also had a plan, but they had the advantage in numbers. Veronica Wu had taken great pains to ensure the EF would pay for the destruction of the Conscon fleet. 
<br><br>
By this time, Olivia Baklitskaia had joined Anya Wilds in guarding Florian Cuyler in his Schnee Weiss.
<br><br>
"So, is he hot, this Newtype pilot? I heard Newtypes were pretty hot." Olivia liked getting to know her fellow pilots, especially the good ones.
<br><br>
"Actually, I heard he's taken, and a little bit of a wimp. He's a good pilot, though." Wilds was disappointed that she hadn't thought of something more sarcastic to say. She blamed the imminent battle for that, though. She was still new to this space combat thing, and she didn't want to make any mistakes.
<br><br>
"Pity." Olivia was disappointed, but not deterred. She'd make a judgement herself after seeing the pilot in person. She looked at the Schnee Weiss, and wondered why two new pilots had been assigned to guard it. More likely, he would be guarding them - not that they' have much to worry about from the EF space forces. Rumor around the fleet was that their forces were almost unassailable. She supposed they would see about that.
<br><br>
Elsewhere in the ZEF, Emil Myberg sat alongside Richard Banks, both in their Rick Dom IIs, wondering how Florian was doing, and preparing for the recent battle. Emil needled Banks a bit about his still-damaged Rick Dom II, inquiring as to whether it was leaking oxygen, or wondering aloud whether it could still shoot straight. Much of Banks' Rick Dom II was still waiting for replacement armor, and the thing looked even more awkward than normal, especially next to Emil's functioning Rick Dom II.
<br><br>
Richard just shrugged off the good-natured jibes. He knew that his Rick Dom was in no shape to fight any EF prototype suits, but if he was lucky, he'd be able to shell a ship or two, or an unsuspecting mobile suit. He patted his bazooka fondly as he waited for the ZEF to confront the Federation fleet. It wouldn't be long now.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Zeon ships have appeared above, below, ahead, to the right, and behind us, sir!" The novice navigations "expert" was clearly nervous, but with good cause. It was one of his first real engagements with the Zeeks, and their opponent was one of considerable power.
<br><br>
"Excellent. Thank you, private." Patrick Foley had faced such odds before - and worse - and come out on top. "Deploy our GMs and Saberfish, and send everything we have at the ships. We'll give those damn Zeeks something to remember."
<br><br>
Veronica Wu saw the Federation fleet there, waiting patiently for her attack, and she smiled. She would take the bait.
<br><br>
"Begin the artillery barrages."
<br><br>
The Federation ships shook with the force of the artillery, but with evasive maneuvers, they managed to escape relatively unscathed. The Zeon ships were approaching into MPC range, and Foley was preparing to give the order to fire, when the rest of the ZEF appeared on their left flank. There were too many ships. Surely the ZEF hadn't bolstered their forces so substantially since their last engagement? Surely, his plan would still work!
<br><br>
"Fire on the ships approaching on our left!" The ships they'd seen first weren't real; it was just an instinct, but Foley had learned to trust his instincts, and this one was strong.
<br><br>
"Give them everything we've got! All of them! Our counterattack will finish them off!" The adrenaline of battle flowed through Foley as he gave orders, as the ship rocked back and forth with the force of the enemy's artillery fire, and as the ship banked around to get a better angle for the gunners, and to avoid the imminent MPC fire. The Richmond maneuvered similarly, and the two Magellan-class Federation vessels began blasting the attacking fleets with constant MPC fire.
<br><br>
Several of the Zeon ships shook under the assault from the two Magellans, but not for long. Fire from the Shnei Weiss's bits ripped into the two ships, along with MPC fire from the ZEF ships. Felix Mendahlshon, Yoritomo Naizen and Junichi Ghettid were among the first mobile suits to reach the beleagured ships, and the 4 GMs defending them were ripped to shreds as the experienced Zeon pilots focused their combined attentions on them. The destruction of the Balls came almost as an afterthought, and only just before the explosion of the Melbourne.
<br><br>
Patrick Foley barely had time to curse before him, his dreams, his nightmares, and his problems all disappeared in a rather-impressive explosion. "Bloody Hell!"
<br><br>
The Richmond turned tail and began to run, waiting for the embrace of the rest of the Bollocks fleet as it tried to escape destruction. Caleb Degrau followed close behind in his Gelgoog, firing wildly at the retreating ship. Small explosions bloomed all over its surface, but it somehow held together long enough to retreat into a debris and asteroid field.
<br><br>
"Balloons!" Veronica Wu almost screamed it. "They're hiding behind balloons!" One of the asteroids popped as MPC fire streaked through it, revealing the waiting EF ships behind it. But, the EF ships were in no mood to fight a losing battle, despite the loss of the Melboune, its crew, and its commander. Nacho Quintal had given the order to retreat shortly after he'd gauged the size of the Zeon fleet, and the destruction of the Melbourne. He and his counterattack contingent would have been able to do little to prevent it. What had seemed a fine strategy before had turned into a tactical retreat. The Zeon fleet was too big, and the Federation fleet was too damaged. If they engaged, it would be an even bigger debacle.
<br><br>
And so he had told everyone to retreat to the relative safety of the nearby Ohm fleet. He hadn't explained - he hadn't had time - but he had been followed. The Richmond limped along near the back of the fleet, hoping it would reach the Ohm fleet before they were blasted into pieces. A well-placed EF artillery barrage gave it the edge that it needed to escape. The crew sighed in relief as the Ohm fleet faded into view. They would live to fight another day.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The Zeon fleet was too smart to pursue their quarry into a lion's jaws. Several of their ships had been damaged by the Richmond and Melbourne in the initial fierce assault, and the Ohm fleet was not of inconsiderable strength. Instead, they would celebrate another rout of Federation forces, and the destruction of another one of their ships. They were winning the war in space, and recklessness would not win it any faster.

<br>
The heatwave grips the continent of South America like a scorching fist.  As a region that held tropical rain forests such as the Amazon, such temperatures are not surprising.  Still conditions are uncomfortable at least.  But for those stationed at the Earth Federal base of Rio de Janero, the coastal location eases the smeltering heat.
<br><br>
The statue known as "Christ the Redeemer" stood on top of the Corcovado mountain, overlooking the city.  Arms spread wide, the statue of Jesus Christ seem to welcome the citizens of Rio de Janero into his wisdom.
<br><br>
For the Federal military personnel, the statue offered a point of reference for the defense of the coastal jungle urban fortification.  Keeping the statue company are a pair of Type 74 vehicles.  Spread around the city and the surrounding Tijuca Forest are various fixed defenses.
<br><br>
In its harbor, the Himalaya-class <i>Excalibur</i> lay moored to the pier.  Her escort ship, the Hillock-class <i>Plain</i>, maintains a vigilant watch over the port as convoys arrive and depart on a daily basis.  Everyone in Rio de Janero understood the importance of the base in the supply chain between Jaburo and Belfast.  Some even pride themselves as the major contributors to the success of the Odessa offensive.
<br><br>
Most thank their luck however, that they haven't been attacked by Zeon forces so far.  There is no telling how much damage would be done, but even a diversionary attack will offset the delicate timetable of the supply convoys.  Perhaps the Zeon forces are truly crippled by the loss of Odessa and the South American base would never be threatened.
<br><br>
That is, until the waters off the coast of Rio de Janero erupts with the launching of missiles.  
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The Mad Angler-class <i>Pendragon</i> shook as its ten missile launchers discharged another wave.  Lieutenant Alec Irusk waited patiently in his Z'Gok-E as the mobile suit bay is flooded.  The warmonger took the moment to recall his meeting with the fleet's commander.
<br><br>
Captain Marina Nimue is everything the rumors said she would be.  Brutally effective and visually deceptive.  The petite Schutzstaffel officer looks more of a high schooler than a veteran frontline commander.  But then again, Irusk is an artillery man who is now part of the MSM force.
<br><br>
<i>"You come highly recommended, 2nd Lieutenant Irusk. I just hope you don't end up disappointing me..."</i> she had said.
<br><br>
"Don't worry ma'am," mumbled Irusk to himself in his cockpit," your standards aren't the only one I'm trying to meet."
<br><br>
Outside the Mad Angler, Sergeant Gil Krundel rubs his eyes.  The Grabro pilot had one too many beers the night before and he hoped the rocking of his marine mobile armor won't upset his stomach too much.
<br><br>
Closer to the shore, the monoeye of a Gyan Test Type emerges from the water.  Lieutenant Colonel Esther MacKernan looked around as her still damaged mobile suit climbed onto the beach.  With the Federal defenders focused on the submarine threat, Esther should have no problems in-
<br><br>
The Gyan's monoeye suddenly meets the green visor of a GM.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Back at Rio de Janero, things are growing desperate.
<br><br>
The indiscriminate missile bombardment are taking a toll on the Federal response.  Aircraft are caught on the airfield as the runways are taking a beating.  The civilian population is in a panic as they flee away from the direction of the Federal base.
<br><br>
The commander of the base burst onto the bridge of the <i>Excalibur</i>.  "Status report!" demanded Marnery.
<br><br>
"We confirmed five submerged ships to the north!  They are circling the harbor."
<br><br>
"How did they get past our minefield?"
<br><br>
"Unknown sir!  The Type 74s said they just swam right through it without setting anything off!"
<br><br>
"Where are our Don Escargots and Aqua GMs?"
<br><br>
"Still launching!"
<br><br>
"Well, get us moving!" demanded Marnery as he takes his seat," and get the <i>Plain</i> to set up a ASW screen.  I want enough depth charges in the water to be able to walk from here to Belfast without getting wet!"
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The battle of Rio de Janero quickly divided into two zones of control.  In the sky, the Federal defenders ruled supreme as the single Zeon Dopp is blotted out of the sky.  But anywhere close to the water is fiercely contested or controlled by the Schutzstaffel Tactical Fighting Unit.  MSMs pop out of the water as they ravaged low flying aircraft.  Don Escargots continue to drop depth charges in vain as Fly Mantas try to hit exposed Zeon aquatic mobile suits.
<br><br>
The two Federal naval ships exited the harbor, hoping to add their firepower to the defense on the naval front.  But Marina was waiting for that.  The experienced SS captain sighted the two ships in her persicope on the bridge of the <i>Pendragon</i>.
<br><br>
"Match bearings and shoot!" she ordered as the Mad Angeler's torpedo tubes let loose their deadly cargo.
<br><br>
On the Himalaya, Marnery concentrated all of his Don Escargots from his ship the <i>Excalibur</i> onto the one target they had a definitive lockon:  the <i>U-49 Excalibur</i>.  Hopefully by focus firing on each Jukon II, Marnery can loosen the noose tying around Rio de Janero.
<br><br>
The <i>U-49</i> tried to dodge but the shallow waters restricted it movements.  Finally a trio of depth charges broke the Jukon II's keel as one <i>Excalibur</i> killed another.
<br><br>
But Marnery's plan is not to be.  Gil Krundle wrapped the arms of his mobile armor around the stricken Hillock.  The <i>Plain</i> had taken direct hits from the <i>U-18 Merlin</i> and the <i>U-77 Lorelay</i>.  The Grabro mobile armor crumbled the gunship like a sheet of aluminum foil.
<br><br>
Alec Irusk was also busy as he gutted an Aqua GM and pinned it to the bottom of the Himalaya's hull.  The explosion of the dying Federal aquatic mobile suit coupled with the relentless torpedo spread from the Marina's Mad Angler and the other Jukon IIs tore apart the carrier in a massive explosion.
<br><br>
Soldiers who are trying to hide from the Zeon missile barrage looked up from their foxholes to see the Himalaya be reduced to a million pieces. From where their commander died, they can now see MSMs climbing onto shore.
<br><br>
Half a dozen GMs and nearly a dozen Type 61s met this advance.  The dug in Federal troops took down some of the elite pilots of the Schutzstaffel Tactical Fighting Unit.  MacKernan pushed the third GM she had to decapitate off her Gyan Test Type.  More Fanfans buzzed around her, proving to be more annoying than anything to eliminate.  MacKernan wiped her face with her red scarf as she sees the line of MSMs move back to the water.
<br><br>
The small victory in defending the shores of Rio de Janero is shortlived however.  As the defenders were busy on the beaches, the MSM teams of Gil Krundle and Alec Irusk were stripping the skies of Don Escargots.  Very soon, none were left and the Schutzstaffel Tactical Fighting Unit can cotinue unmolested.
<br><br>
The Federal garrison once again braced itself for another landing force, but none came.  As day slowly turned into night, the missile barrage from the Schutzstaffel Tactical Fighting Unit continued.  Block by block the city is flattened.  Even the superior Federal air presence is eliminated as fuel-depleted planes tried to land on the airfield, only to fall victim to the rain of missiles.
<br><br>
Throughout the night it continued, pounding rubble into more rubble.  Nothing was spared, nothing was preserved of the Federal base.  This is not a mission of occupation or control.  It is an extermination.
<br><br>
The first rays of dawn shined on the face of the statue "Christ the Redeemer".  Surprisingly untouched by the relentless downpour of high explosives and incendiaries, the icon of Christ still stood on its mountain peak.  His arms are still outstretched, as if welcoming the new day.
<br><br>
