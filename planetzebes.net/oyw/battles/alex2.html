Compared to the rest of the war torn Earth Sphere, Side 6 was a lone bastion of peace, floating in harmony amongst a sea of despair. No other civilian center could boast that they were so displaced from the battlefield, not even the Lunarians of Von Braun. The Antarctic Treaty, political neutrality, and a reasonable defense force kept the one hundred and six space colonies from any kind of harm. Federation and Zeon soldiers took leave on these man-made islands, but even then they did not engage in petty fights or arguments. Often you could see Federation and Zeon drinking at the same bar, exchanging jokes and watching a sporting event. Side 6 was where everyone wanted to be.
<br><br>
The colony of Libot, in Side 6's bunch 35, was no different. Somewhat close in its positioning to Neo Hong Kong and Neo Vegas, Libot was somewhat more industrialized than the other colonies, but still had great expanses of woodlands and small townships in its center. Candelabra was known for being more of a religious colony, with many temples and relics saved from the destruction of war and sent there. Candelabra was also known for its oceans, having filled its three colony mirrors with water for a means of fishing and relaxation. Libot on the other hand, was famous for its pro Federation sentiments. Although Side 6's civilians did not want to be part of the war, the majority of Libots population sided with the EF, if you were to ask them for an honest opinion.
<br><br>
But still, war was far away here, Christmas being a larger concern on everyones mind. Huge balloons of santa claus and his reindeer were floated above stores, and Christmas trees were sold in car dealership lots. Shopping was booming all over the colony, and peoples savings were spent on presents for their families and themselves. People smiled, they sang, they made merry. The colonial government had even tried to make it snow for the occasion, but an immediate petition from angry citizens had put a stop to that. Playing in the snow was one thing, but cleaning it up was something else entirely.
<br><br>
In a clothing store on the cities south end, a young red headed girl thumbed through sweaters, looking for just the right color. She was dressed in civilian clothing, but she was actually a soldier. An Earth Federation test pilot, in fact. There had been a lot of them here recently, but tourists were a healthy part of the Side 6 community, and no one really paid it any heed. This particular girl was in for a double treat. Her family was from Side 6, and lived right in Libot. The sweater, she picked out a very handsome blue, was a Christmas present for her neighbors son, a young gradeschooler named Alfred. He was almost like a brother to her.
<br><br>
"This'll do just fine." Christina smiled, twirling in a circle with the sweater in her arms, as if she was playing with the boy. She went up to the counter absolutely beaming, paying the old woman at the desk, who found Chris's appreciation infectious. With a cool chime of a cash register closing, she was out the door and flagging down a taxi. Most people in space colonies did not own their own cars, as the colonies themselves were small enough that a bicycle was enough to get from one end to the other. However, Chris was used to Earth by now, having spent several years in the military, and she liked the comfort of sitting in a car.
<br><br>
"207 Pine Street please." She told the driver, trying to infect him as well with her contagious smile. They chatted on the way, both of them laughing, as if there was not a care in the entire universe.
<br><br>
She snuck up to the door as quietly as she could. Her parents already knew she was here, but Al did not, as she had only arrived herself two days ago, and had been stuck doing work in another part of the city. She wanted to make a big impression.
<br><br>
"Hey! Chris!" Al said, running out of the bushes at the edge of the yard. Their house was at the edge of town, close to one of the colonies forests, and Al looked an absolute mess. He leapt on Christina, knocking her over and spilling her shopping bag all over the yard. The blue sweater was exposed, landing on a rose bush.
<br><br>
"I didn't know you were coming home for Christmas! Are you really a mobile suit pilot? What's the war like? Did you bring me anything from Earth? Have you beaten any Zeons yet? Have you seen the Gundam?" Al asked, stammering each question one after the other. He was a young boy, and like many young boys, his thoughts always moved in a particular direction.
<br><br>
"Now now Al, don't wear my daughter out before dinner." Mrs. MacKenzie said, smiling and looking down. Al had Christina absolutely pinned, and it didn't look like he would let go.
<br><br>
"Hey! What's this??" He said, immediately leaping off of her and grabbing the sweater from the rose bush.
<br><br>
"Well, it was supposed to be your Christmas present, but now I guess I'll have to get something else." Christina chuckled. Her mom made a scowling face as Al donned the sweater, straight over his already muddied clothes.
<br><br>
"Christina, you shouldn't encourage him like that. Al, go home wash up and change your clothes, we're having dinner soon and if you're presentable you can come too." She said. Al immediately zoomed off, running next door with a frenzy that could only be attributed to youth. Christinas mother helped her up, holding both her hands and smiling. She had so many questions to ask, but not before her baby girl had had a home cooked meal.

"Sir!" 1st Lieutenant Steiner Hardie, commander of the MAFs infamous Cyclops Team, saluted Colonal Killing. They were deep within Granada, not far from Flanagans labs. The rest of the team stood at attention behind Steiner. Gabriel Ramirez Garcia, weapons expert, Mikhail Kaminsky, the teams best pilot, and Bernard Wiseman. Bernie was new.
<br><br>
"Good to see you Lieutenant. As you know, this mission and even this briefing are highly classified." Killing said, looking at the lot through sunken, beady eyes. He was a despicable man, and this was readily evident just by his appearance.
<br><br>
"Sir, we understand sir." Steiner responded. He was an old veteran, having served even during the Riah Revolution. His experience in Side 6 was the primary reason for his teams involvement with this mission.
<br><br>
"Good. Now, this may come as a surprise to you, but we have found evidence that the Federation has recently built a new base inside of Side 6, where they are doing the final testing on what is likely to be a new model of Gundam..."
