Despite the violence that rocked this area, a more subtle war is being raged.  Mother Nature is laying siege to the city of Manila.  The ruins are slowing be reclaimed by the jungle.  What few inhabitants survived the clash between Zeon and Earth Federal Forces are scavenging among the ruins for supplies.  A few of them looked up as an all too familiar sound greeted them.
<br><br>
"Where is everybody?"
<br><br>
The groundshaking footstep of a Gouf Custom caused the refugees to seek cover.  Oberscharfuhrer Rose Adeline brushed back her hair as the Gouf Custom's monoeye sweeped over the smoking ruins of manila.  The devasatation is testimony to how hard it was for Manila to change hands in the recent past. A moment of silence passed as the Gouf pilot absorbs her surroundings.
<br><br>
"This place sucks."
