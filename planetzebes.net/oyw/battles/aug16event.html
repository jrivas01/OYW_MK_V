"We're in position now, looks like they spotted us and are closing up the front doors though." Mao, the comm officer aboard Roslyn O'Hara's ship <i>Zinnia</i> said through the comm line.
<br><br>
Roslyn was just making her final checks in the Kampfer when the message came through.  Hastily she shut the cockpit hatch, grabbed a weapon and made preparations to launch.  "I guess I'd better hurry then.  I heard the Feddies tried a similar move, but didn't have any luck breaking down the door with anti-MS weapons."
<br><br>
Moments later, Roslyn found herself floating in front of a very much closed door to a mine.  She wondered how the Zeon knew that this particular Kampfer was not their friend.  Surely there were other Kampfer type MS floating around somewhere.  Then again, there was really only one reason someone would visit a dump this remote with a mobile suit. After a few unsuccessful radio attempts at convincing the mine's operators to open the door, Roslyn finally gave up and decided to try her luck where the Feddies had failed. 
<br><br>
"Well, the paycheck from the mine would have been nice, but we still need to put on a show here," Roslyn said, punctuating each shot with a blast from her shotgun.  She tried a few of the other weapons she brought with her, and each had a similar effect.  Which is to say that it likely cost the Zeon an afternoon repainting their front door.
<br><br>
Satisfied that she'd put sufficient effort into trying and that further effort would be a waste of time, Roslyn returned to the <i>Zinnia</i> and gave orders to retreat in case Zeonic reinforcements came to investigate.
