<br>
The dockyards of the Zeon base named "Purgatorio" are buzzing with activity.  Situated on the front line between Zeon and Federal fleets, the space fortification is closer than even Texas Colony to the heat of battle.  Despite its proximity to danger, Purgatorio is valuable as a staging area and repair facility for the autonomous units of the Zeon space forces.
<br><br>
The crews and garrison know how important they are.  So even as the ships of the Zeon Expeditionary Force secured themselves in the Ship DOck, maintenance and repair crews swarmmed over the battle scarred hulls like ants at a picnic.
<br><br>
The repair teams aren't the only ones alert and ready.  The station's defense crew is keeping constant vigil on the Federal battle line.  It didn't take very long for the Listening Post to detect the intruder and alert Purgatorio.
<br><br>

<br>
Colonel Veronica Wu, commander of Zeon space autonomous forces, walked through the doors of Purgatorio's command center.  An air of authority and seriousness flowed with her as she took a quick look around the room.
<br><br>
"Status report," she demanded.
<br><br>
"Colonel, we have detected a single unit heading towards our vicinity," reported a bridge officer," weapons are online and locked on."
<br><br>
"Any radio contact?"
<br><br>
"Negative, no energy emissions at all.  Heat, light, etc.  No course changes either."
<br><br>
"Colonel?  The <i>Lucifer's Fury</i> is hailing us," announced a communications specialist.
<br><br>
"<i>Comrade colonel</i>," came the thick Russian accent of Captain Aleksandra Beria,"<i> radar officer report enemy incoming.  My ship is ready to launch.  I have recon team watching target already.</i>"
<br><br>
"Not so fast, Captain Beria," objected Veronica.  To the command crew around her," Is the target within weapons range?"
<br><br>
"Yes ma'am."
<br><br>
"And no radio contact with the target?"
<br><br>
"Negative."
<br><br>
"Then you are clear to open fire with the main batteries."
<br><br>
With practiced efficiency, the two SAM turrets on Purgatorio turned towards the incoming unit.  Engines flared as missiles left their tubes.  A few seconds later, the target is blotted out of existence.
<br><br>
Veronica watched the spectacle with a raised eyebrow.  "Send Beria's recon team to check out the remains.  I want to know what that was and why it was sent at us to die."
<br><br>
Within an hour, it was clear that the intruder was a dummy balloon.  As to the reason why it was sent to their way, no one knew.

"Sir! We've got enemies coming at us - too many to count!"
<br><br>
"This is what we've waited for. Deploy all mobile suits, train the ship guns on my command. Hold fire until I give the order. Get Dozle Zabi on the line."
<br><br>
The Helsing fleet floated through space. The flagship Graf Zeppelin had been on patrol for months, guarding this area of space with professionalism and order. But even it was not prepared for what it was about to meet.
<br><br>
The evil eyes of Zakus poured from the Chivvays, Tivays, and Musais of Helsing Fleet. All in all, around 30 mobile suits scrambled. Mostly Zakus, led by two Rick Doms. Also joining them were the 8 Gattles of the Tanhauser, a dilapitated Chivvay. 
<br><br>
The Gattles took point, scanning the enemy units. They made close passes, there seemed to be countless ball units. The three Gattles leading the wing scanned expertly, noting all the units. One Gattle pilot wondered if this was some ship killing squadron. Strangely enough, none of them attacked. The three circled back. The five rookies behind them, their underlings, were not so professional. One poured vulcan fire into the Balls.
<br><br>
And they popped. Dozens of them popped. Once the other four were aware of this, they opened fire as well. The three superior officers came in range of the bridge of the Graf Zeppelin, firing off a flare that noted balloons. The Graf commander gave the order, and fire poured out from all ships and mobile suits. Even if it was just a bunch of balloons, they could use the target practice. The legion of Balls was mowed down, from the 99 initial given in the report, to 1. The last survivor floated off into space, out of range.
