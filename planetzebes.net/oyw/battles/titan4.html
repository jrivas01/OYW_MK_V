Jamitov Heimann gritted his teeth angrily. At first, the admiral had been pleased to see Lieutenant Francois again, but after she handed him the orders from Jaburo, his mood had soured massively. The formerly sealed manila envelope lay callously discarded on the edge of the desk; as soon as Jamitov had seen the header of the documentation within, he's crumpled the bottom and tossed it aside.
<br><br>
<center><b>DISPATCH</b>
<br>FROM: EARTH FEDERATION SPACE FORCES HEADQUARTERS, LUNA-2
<br>TO: EARTH FEDERATION SPACE FORCES TECHNICAL EVALUATION CENTER, GREEN NOAH
<br>ATTN: ADM. JAMITOV HEIMANN
<br>BEGIN MESSAGE
<br>PROJECT PHANTOM IS HEREBY CANCELLED, EFFECTIVE UPON RECEIPT OF THIS DISPATCH. WHILE IMPRESSIVE, THE ADVANTAGES OFFERED BY THE ZEPHYR PHANTOMS FAIL TO OFFSET JABURO'S BUDGETARY CONCERNS. DISCONTINUE ALL DEVELOPMENT IMMEDIATELY. REPURPOSE ALL APPLICABLE EQUIPMENT. ALL REMAINING PROTOTYPES ARE TO BE DESTROYED AT ONCE.
<br>END MESSAGE</center>
<br><br>
"Unthinkable," Jamitov muttered. "That machine is perfect... it will win the war, and those penny-pinchers in Jaburo can't be assed to see beyond their own funding allotments?!" He angrily flung the orders across the office; they came to rest on a plush carpet some feet away, gently floating to the ground as the ventilation system recirculated air towards the faux wainscoting.
<br><br>
"I'll put out the orders, Admiral," Marie nodded, somewhat solemnly. She knew much of Jamitov's machinations, perhaps better than anyone, and the potency of the blow he'd just received. Jamitov rubbed the white cloth gloves against his eyelids as she turned to leave.
<br><br>
"Wait," he said as she approached the door. "When you confirm the order, inform that ne'er-do-well Wakkein that both prototypes were lost during testing."
<br><br>
"But, Admiral..." she began.
<br><br>
"Furthermore, I want the Phantom staff transferred to Green Oasis. We'll "repurpose" the shelters for the data centers. That'll keep those nosy inspectors from probing where they don't belong," Jamitov scowled.
<br><br>
"Admiral, we're violating a direct order... what if they find out?" Marie implored, looking somewhat pleading.
<br><br>
"They won't. Send both units to Green Oasis as well. All field deployments must be cleared with me personally," Jamitov said. "We needed to start atmospheric testing anyway..."
<br><br>
"Um, very well, sir," Marie nodded uncomfortably.
<br><br>
"Have Jamaican start scrapping Units 4 and 5, that'll prove to Wakkein that we've destroyed the prototypes..."
<br><br>
"He doesn't know that work went ahead on more than two units?" Marie asked quizzically.
<br><br>
"No," Jamitov said flatly, eyes making contact with hers as he tented his fingers in front of his face, "He doesn't."
<br><br>
"Understood sir" Marie finished, bowing and moving out of the dark room. Jamitov was left to brood. That upstart Revil was never interested in progress. Progress that could counter those blasted spacenoids and their genetic mishaps, the newtypes. If artificial intelligence wasn't the answer, perhaps...
<br><br>
Jamitov started to grin hideously, picking up the phone at his desk.
<br><br>
"Have Dr. Murasame brought to my office immediately."
<br><br>
He slammed the phone back on the desk, the dark office returning to its former silence. Jamitov leaned forward, interlocking his fingers and peering over his hands as his elbows rested on the wood.
<br><br>
If he couldn't get around using newtypes, perhaps the answer was to make his own.
