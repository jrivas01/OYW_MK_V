<br>
Under the starry night, vengeance lurked in the dark waters of the Pacific.  It stalks like a prehistoric leviathan waiting for the prey it sensed to venture closer.
<br><br>
Obersturmfuhrer Xaviar Brennan fumed as he impatiently watches the bridge crew of the <i>U-88 Baekhesten</i> guides the Jukon II through the dark waters.  Not too far off their starboard bow, the <i>Lorelay</i> follows vigilantly under the guidance of Marina Nixie Nimue.  There is visible battle damage on both subs which somewhat reduced their top speed.
<br><br>
The dark aura radiating from Brennan silenced all conversation around him.  Despite the losses he inflicted on the 42nd Brigade, the loss of the Recon Gaw stands out in his mind.  To make the matters worse, he had become suspicious of this Hans Bond operative sent to him by the SS.  The only way to keep the agent away from Marina was to put Bond on another ship.
<br><br>
While the Obersturmfuhrer dwells in dark thoughts, two crew members at the weapons console spoke to each other in hushed voices.
<br><br>
"Has anyone told him about the targetting problem?"
<br><br>
"Do you <b>WANT</b> to die?"
<br><br>

It had been a long day for the crew of the Dish aircraft of the 42nd Brigade.  The Medeas of the fleet are barely flying again.  The Dish operators felt very vulnerable  without their Don Escargots.  The Zeon threat is hidden under the dark surface of the Pacific Ocean and while the sky is clear, an ambush from below can catch them without any ways of retaliating.
<br><br>
A sharp beeping sound made everyone jump out of their skin.  Nervous fingers worked dials until an alarmed operator stammered out the dreadful words.
<br><br>
"Massive objects rising to the surface! ... Contact immienent!"
<br><br>
"Get the Medas on the f**king line NOW!" screamed their officer.
<br><br>
As the first water sprouts bubbled into existance, people began to wake up.  Exhausted by the day full of captured Medeas and sinking Big Trays, a wave of alarm spread over the sight of missile blooms.
<br><br>
On the <i>Llud</i>, Jarvis Ackart and Aurem Senaiha burst onto the bridge of the Medea.  Both pilots are securing their helmets to prepare for battle.  But their worst fears are realized when they are told that the attack is from under the surface of the Pacific Ocean.  Neither of them can fight acquatic units in the deep ocean.
<br><br>
The engines of the Federal aircraft all went to overdrive as planes did their own evasive manuevers.  Tin Cods broke formation to make way for the lumbering transports as Zeon missiles flew into the air.  But rather than snake like surface to air missiles, they rose straight up into the atmosphere before trying to angle back towards the Federal fleet.  The large cumbersome missiles are ideal for surface to surface engagements but lack the sophistication to track fast moving targets like aircraft.
<br><br>
Close passed by missiles drove some crew members futilely diving for cover.  It wasn't until a few minutes after the howling of the last missiles resided did some people ventured a look outside the windows.
<br><br>
The tranquility of the ocean defies the near death experience they just had.  Below them, fire still burned as Xaviar Brennan furiously grabbed the weapons officer and demanded:
<br><br>
"WHAT IN THE NAME OF ZUM CITY DO YOU MEAN THEY ALL MISSED?!"
<br><br>
