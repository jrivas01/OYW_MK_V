The Principality of Zeon's Musai is a light cruiser designed specifically for mobile suit operations. The first of its kind, it pioneered amazing victory in the early stages of the war by acting as a fire support unit and carrier for Zeon's mobile suits. Well suited to supporting at long range, its lack of point defense meant immense casualties upon the dawn of the Federation's mobile suit program. An undamaged Musai could launch a full complement of mobile suits - but beyond this was easy pickings for a roaming mobile suit squadron. Without mobile suits, it could outrun a Federation Columbus. The Alecto was one of these, only totaled beyond the imagination. It would be lucky to outrun a snail.
<br><br>
The 402nd Nefertiti Squadron of the EFSF floated through space in complete silence. A slingshot off Earth Orbit carried them at high speeds - their GM commands silhouetted in the sun. This, combined with the minovsky particles, brought them within firing range to the complete surprise of the Alecto. Sixteen GM commands, three Salamis Refits behind them floated into view, and alarms were sounded all around. The Zeon Expeditionary Fleet, heavily damaged from its recent forays with the Federation's Bollocks fleet, was still repairing from its last engagements. Zakus, outfitted for repair duty, flew around in a panic. One determined pilot set course directly away from the fleet, threw off its weapons, and ran. 
<br><br>
Mobile suits deployed frantically from the other ships. Forming up under Lieutenant Commander Richard Banks were three Petty Officers and an Officer Candidate. Four Gelgoogs and a Bigro helped the fleet's Papua set course away from the fleet, in an effort to save their supplies. A Gattle fell among them, like a red headed step child. Lieutenant J.G. Walker was assertive as ever. 1st Petty Officer Emil's hand gripped a trigger as the GM Commands entered combat range. But strangely enough, they still did not fire. Banks signaled the squad to fall back, as an MAF squad came into view. The Papua fell out of range quickly. 
<br><br>
The Athena's Wrath took point, and Veronica Wu was informed of the arrival. Mobile suit teams were mobilized. The Motley MAF crew - a Perfect Zeong, Val Varo, Action Zaku and Gelgoog faced off. They were outnumbered, but superior in skill. Wu was confident with the supplies safe that they could clean up this advanced EFSF force. The Musai-class Megaera and its sister unit, Freyas Anger, moved in opposite directions, letting the Alecto take the center while they engaged the Salamis at flanks. Mobile suits stared down the advancing forces. The Alecto's captain, an old old man, regretted not spending more time with his daughter in Side 3. A flashback with a bike, his sullen rejection, and his forlorn exit marred his thoughts as the GMs appeared right before him. There could be no escape. 
<br><br>
Mega particles filled the darkness of space, and the blinding light of battle eneveloped them all. Anya charged the lines with her Gelgoog, hacking two of her enemies in half. The Perfect Zeong was at her back, pouring mega particle fire into the cloud of units. Yoritomo's Action Zaku expertly shot for critical points. Eight GMs approached too quickly, and Anya screamed as the targets proved too many to take. The Val Varo was off, punching holes in the Salamis. It seemed to be her last stand. And then, a Gattle flashed across her screen. Like flying saviors, their SAF counterparts flew in to the rescue. The Gelgoogs poured beam fire into the advanced forces, and the Bigro grabbed two of them, crushing them in its heavy hands. The Salamis burst into an explosion, and the Val Varo flew back victorious. 
<br><br>
Nothing save for a single GM command, floating into the bridge of the Alecto. The old captain jumped to the floor, the bridge stood valiantly. He stood at the window as the mobile suit approached, and was thrown to the floor while it hit. Fires broke out and sparks rained down around him. The window was black. A balloon? He wasn't sure if he was thankful or ashamed. The fires were just regular repairs, thrown off kilter by the overeager balloon.

"Very sure. There's no doubt about it."

"All balloons?"

Haifa Hahnemuehle sat in the passenger seat of the transport heading for Earth Orbit, watching the two pilots argue about some blips they saw on their sensors.  These same blips were also what had caused the three hour delay in leaving California base.  It originally hadn't mattered to Haifa what they were seeing on their sensors, she was just happy to be returning to space.  It may not be back to the Agressor squadrons, but it was still a lot closer to home than Earth.  Now however, the pilot's argument began to interest her.
<br><br>
"I'm telling you, that's not normal, that isn't space debris."  One said to the other.
<br><br>
"Nah, it's fine, bro.  You worry too much."
<br><br>
"But they shouldn't be moving like that.  I mean, have you ever seen space debris change direction on its own?"
<br><br>
"I'm sure it's just the fact that we are moving too.  We'll be fine."
<br><br>
"....You really have no idea how these things work, do you?"
<br><br>
The second pilot shrugged.  "Hasn't failed me yet."
<br><br>
Haifa had other thoughts though.  "Enough, I'm convinced those are real ships as well.  That makes it two to one.  Turn this ship around.  There's too many of them out there if they are.  It's too dangerous right now."  
<br><br>
The second pilot frowned, but compliantly began to turn the ship back toward California Base.  Reports later indicated that they would have stumbled right into the middle of a Federation training excersize unarmed.  Haifa's return to space would have to wait for another day, but at least she was still in one piece.
