<br>
Space can be a dangerous place with all the EF and Zeon fighting, but it is even more dangerous with Pirates in the mix. Today however this was not the case because the pirate team known as the Black Rock Pirates were busy fighting each other. A few miles away from the asteroid mine known as Port Royal, two members of the Black Rock Pirates were prepared for battle. On the left stood Samuel Riley in his Rick Dom II and on the other side floated James Radcliffe in his Val Varo mobile armor.
<br><br>
These two pirates are usually too busy being partners in crime but today, since they have the time, they decided to see just how they stack up against one another. The two of them looking at the others mobile weapon from the safely of their cockpits. They both wait for someone to make the first move.
<br><br>

<br>
James could not stand the waiting any longer and decided to move first against his boss. The Val Varo boosted towards the Rick Dom II with its claws extended. Samuel then thrusted upwards to get up above the Val Varo and fired a shoot off with its bazooka. Acting on reflex and once in a lifetime timing the Val Varo narrowly avoided the bazooka shell. The Val Varo then made a wide angle turn, charging his large mega particle cannon, and fired the mobile armors cannon as it finished its charging turn maneuver.. Samuel barely managed to maneuver his Rick Dom II out of the line of fire but it wasn't good enough as the beam took out the bazooka and shorted out the circuits in that same arm. Samuel cursed inside of his mobile suit and thrusted towards the Val Varo yet again. The Rick Dom II's only remaining weapons were its scattering beam gun and its rocket-propelled Panzer Faust warhead.
<br><br>
James saw that the Rick Dom II was heading towards him again, so he once again tries his luck with his mobile armors claws. Samuel's idea for wining were to use the Rick Dom II's scattering beam gun to deal damage to the mobile armor. In theory it would of worked if the Val Varo wasn't flying on its side. Samuel fired his gun anyways as some shots grazed against the Val Varo causing some short outs in the Claw arm controls.
<br><br>
James then rolled away and made a sharp turn which caused some stress on the frame of the mobile armor and fired all four of its 110m machine guns at the Rick Dom II. The gun hits was successful in knocking out the boosters in the legs of the Rick Dom II leaving it adrift in space. Confident in his vi9ctory the Val Varo boosts back to the asteroid mine leaving the Rick Dom II to find a ride of his own.

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>The "Streets" Of Belfast: Irwin vs Gano</b></font></center>
<br>
The green grass seemed to sway like emerald waves as the wind blew across the rolling hills of Ireland. Charles Gano was taking in the beauty from the hangar bay, positive and confident that he would soon hang up his pilot suit and the war would be over; soon he could get back to his true love, dancing...
<br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
<i>"Charlie boy! Charlie boy!" An old lady called out from a small shack, back in one of the many alleys of New York city, beckoning the young boy for dinner. Sweat coalesced upon his brow as he looked up from his activities. He picked up his card board mat, removing his sweatband he ran back to have some of his mama's cooking; he had enough dancing for the day.
<br><br>
"See you guys tomorrow..." He waved back to his dance crew as he left.
<br><br>
<b>During Dinner...<b>
<br><br>
"But Mother! I want to be a dancer!" He slammed his fists passionately against the dinner table, appalled that his mother would crush his dreams.
<br><br>
"Its whats best for you, its a chance to serve your government, to help and be somebody...to get out of those 'Streets'" She tried to plead with him.
<br><br>
"I AM somebody!" Charles Gano began to get indignant as he couldn't understand why she didn't want him dancing in the "streets".
<br><br>
"You have no choice Charlie, you're recruiter picks you up tomorrow son."
<br><br>
"But mama! I wanna dance!" He stormed off in a fit...</i>
<br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Hey buddy." A voice came from behind Gano as Jim Irwin approached the GMPGT pilot. They had been sitting idle at Belfast for some time as they repaired their fleet, and Irwin had grown restless, he wanted some seat time, to make sure he didn't get rusty; he figured he'd challenge his fellow soldier to a spar.
<br><br>
"Hmmm?" Charles looked up, curious as to what Jim wanted. 
<br><br>
"Don't suppose you'd be interested in a quick spar, harmless little exercise?"
<br><br>
Gano's mind was still on the good old days when he was a care free kid, dancing in the streets, battling to see who had the best crew on the block. He let out a sigh, then a light bulb went off in his head and music began playing over the loud speaker in the hangar.
<br><br>
<i><b>Cue Music - Church by T-pain</b></i>
<br><br>
"Sure... but we do this my way!" He hopped up off the crate he had been sitting on, and when his feet hit the ground he was magically in a totally different outfit; an adidas track suit, gold chain and bucket hat. "You gonna get served!"
<br><br>
Irwin looked around as a crowd appeared out of no where, surrounding them, and the music had only grown louder. He raised an eyebrow in confusion.
<br><br>
<i>"What the fu..."</i>
<br><br>
Before he could finish his thought, Charles jumped out in the middle of the crowd and began to pop and lock. The aspiring dancer was rocking on his heels, working the crowd as he pumped his fists back and forth, starting to krump dance. He got cheers from everyone as he did a one handed back handspring, landing in a pose, crossing his arms and waiting to see what his 'opponent' had.
<br><br>
Jim was dumbfounded as he found himself in baggy jeans, a basketball jersey and baseball cap tipped to the side. 
<br><br>
<i>"The Hell?"</i>
<br><br>
The crowd began booing as Irwin just sat there. Shaking his head, he gave in, his feet began shuffling back and forth as he began to top rock. Irwin dropped back on his left arm, kicking his feet up and stopping, holding the trick before dropping back into windmills. The fighter pilot rocked back up to his feet, pulling out some basic pop and lock moves, ending with his own pose, staring back at Gano.
<br><br>
The crowd went wild as the two stood across the circle from eachother. Gano nodded and with out a word, jumped forward, tucking into a roll, springing out in a twist, landing in a split. He picked himself up and began flailing his arms around wildly in beat with the music, getting aggressive as he spun around, his face almost in Irwin's. He took a step back, mean mugging his opponent, and dropped back into a series of flares, rotating his legs around and around as he kept himself up by his hands. 
<br><br>
"Beat that Fly Booooooooooi!" Gano stepped back to let the pilot do his thing.
<br><br>
"Alright tinkerbell..." Jim put on a serious face as he started off slowly, switching his feet back and forth, increasing his speed as he went in. As he got closer to Gano, he smiled, almost winking at the GMPGT pilot as his feet came to a sudden stop. He spun around, his back to Charles, and he flipped forward, freezing on one hand, kicking his legs out in a split, and grabbing his crotch with his free hand.
<br><br>
"Oooooooooh!" The crowd roared.
<br><br>
He tumbled out into a standing position and began to do the robot, slowly progressing into pop and locking, throwing a little bit of step into it before circling the floor. With a look of determination, he slid his hat around backwards and as he came back to the spot across from Gano he bit his lower lip. It was now or never... He took a running start, flipping in the air, performing a 360 air flare, landing into some ground flares. As his feet pendulated around and around, he counted the beats in his head, bringing his legs up above his body, ending the move with a hand stand.
<br><br> 
The crowd loved this kid, but as soon as they started cheering, he came out of the hand stand with a head spin, spinning until he landed on his back. They lost it, rushing the two, everyone pushing past Gano as they went to congratulate the champion of the "streets", Jim Irwin.
<br><br>
"I'll never be able to live my dream..." Gano hung his head in shame... maybe he was never cut out to be a dancer, maybe the life of a soldier was his destiny after all. "Mama was right..."
