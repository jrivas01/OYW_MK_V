The Grog Blossom was not Ol' Jove's Bones, this much was certain. Bones was more than a ship, it was a house. It was a home. Every nook, every cranny, every leaky pipe or creaky floor panel. They were all known to Riley, to every last of his five senses. He was not used to owning a fleet of ships, and while in part it made him feel a bigger man, the rest of him felt overwhelmed. As if this was all too big for his small frame. He would give it all to go back to simpler days.
<br><br>
"Appreciate yer' comin' all this way with me Mutie, Garcia." Riley fiddled with the buttons on his overcoat, trying to look nice. He was after all meeting with bigshots today.
<br><br>
"I still don't know why we're all the way out here. Ships full to high mast with cargo, we should sell 'er and get back to the Bones." Garcia rambled. Mutie let out a soft hiss, the best his voice was capable of. They knew his hisses very well.
<br><br>
"I know Mutie, yer' cap'n knows. No one likes this here wee shitpot we be standin' in. But don't ye get too upset before we've seen the end o' this here operation." Riley chuckled. He'd spent the last ten days with military men, on both sides, and had started referring to things using their lingo. If he hadn't grown up a pirate, he may just have grown up a captain.
<br><br>
"And what operation is that cap'n? Repairing some beat up ten year old ship, getting ourselves shot at by people we don't know, and then going back home if we're lucky? We'll make half what the Blossoms cargo is worth, and have to jettison most of it in the process."
<br><br>
Garcia was annoyed. He turned away from Riley as crackles and beeps sputtered in through the loudspeaker. Tightening his bright pink bandana, he did his work in anger.
<br><br>
"This jobs loonier than a Trannie on Io, let me tell you."
<br><br>
Riley smiled.
<br><br>
"You'll see Garcia, you'll see. Now, don't you two be causin' no trouble once we reach our customer. I wouldn't want those Fed'ration folks to think nothin' were... Amiss."
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=2><b><i>Two Days Later...</i></b></font></center>
<br>
<i>Stardate: Shithole. Space is a shithole, no matter the date.
<br><br>
Been working on my new project. You gotta have a project out here, doing all this sitting around. Especially while the rest of the fuckers are off fighting. Fuckin' girly ass Simmons and Kobayashi getting all the glory. Especially Simmons. Kid practically has vaginas for ears. Anyway.
<br><br>
Been working on figuring out how to play basketball in zero G. Yeah I know, sounds impossible. But shit, taking a goddamn crap in space is harder than anything I thought about when I was a kid. Basketball can't be much worse. The boys and I have been trying it out in the hangar bay. Place is half empty anyway. You know, if I were some fatass bald admiral I'd fill the biggest ship in the damn fleet with the biggest mobile suits in the damn army. Better know those moonfucks over on Side 3 do it. Huge mobile armors n' shit. Lord knows they've all got cocks the size of their own stubby unexercized legs. Anyway.
<br><br>
Like I was saying. We've been working this out, and I think we've got it down. First you--</i>
<br><br>
"Hey Magnum, get the fuck up here! Some distress call or some-fucking-shit!"
<br><br>
The yell bounced around the room. Tracer mumbled, taking another swig of his whiskey.
<br><br>
"Tell Tex I'll be right fucking there! And tell him not to let his pussy bleed out, I'd hate to have to call the damn medic!"
<br><br>
He closed the digital diary, grabbed his gun, and pushed himself off towards the door. He never went anywhere without his gun. A-ny-where. If his penis could fire bullets he'd be a happy man.
<br><br>
The Delphinus roared through the black, flanked on either side by a Salamis. The Andromeda and the Duke were escorting the ship to Luna II, where it would get extensive repairs. Tracer floated into the marines lounge, where most of the ships 72 marines had assembled. Most of them were huddled around in a close circle. A few of the newer marines, enormously tall, blue eyed men, leaned against the back wall. The commander of Delphinus's security, Tex Macken, started his announcement. He so rarely got to make an announcement. This shit was exciting.
<br><br>
"Alright, everybody I care about is here. I guess there's the corpse of some Magellan floatin' around out there, and the capsule is full of crew. We got a distress call anyway."
<br><br>
There was some grumbling amongst the marines. More people on the ship would cut into their valuable Space Basketball time.
<br><br>
"Yeah I know. Anyway this might be some pussy moonfuck ambush, so lets stay sharp for once." Tex grumbled. Moonfuck had become synonomous with Zeon in recent days. Tracer had thought it up, and he thought it was 'like goddamn shakespeare.'
<br><br>
"Jesus shit. If that's all I'm goin' back to my hole." Tracer grumbled, leaning a little. He was a bit drunk. "I was hopin' you'd say they were on their way to the Miss Solar System contest, and some faggot cyclops had accidentally hit their colony with experimental Nympho-Gas. We can call it Nympho 3."
<br><br>
A lot of them chuckled, some others cursed, some others just stood there. Those ones were gay. Bit by bit, the marines shuffled back and went back to their work. All but the ones in the back, with the blue eyes. They looked at each other in silence, one of the giants sliding a long knife out of his coat.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Wait, miss Addie. Just wait."
<br><br>
Samuel watched from the wreckage, the two Rick Doms holding hands. She was being impatient, but she always was. The GM floated over to the Magellan capsule, guiding it carefully back to the Delphinus. It was fortunate that they had a ship with such a big hold, the capsule would never have fit in the Andromeda or the Duke.
<br><br>
"Don't ye' make a move... Not till we see the reds signal."
<br><br>
Addie looked at a note for a second, and then crumpled it up and tossed it aside. After this battle she would tell him. After this, she would tell him how she really felt. She didn't know how long she'd been with Riley, but something about the man. Something about his sweet, browning, buttery substance. It was the way he smelled. Like... He smelled like breakfast in bed. That's what he smelled like.
<br><br>
Rick Dom and Rick Steve watched the capsule be dragged into the bowels of the huge, red space Dolphin. It was like a whale, flanked by two minnows. They watched, and they waited. The timing would have to be perfect.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Captain, they're aboard." One of the aides said. The Gwazines captain nodded. The bridge was full of underaged girls, sitting on these weird stools that hardly looked like chairs. The captain, an old russian with a bushy mustauche, picked his nose.
<br><br>
"Alright, we'll stick around for a minute or two. Send Simmons out in the GM E, ask him if he can find any more survivors. Might be some trapped in that ship. Where's the capsule crew now?"
<br><br>
"Captain, there were quite a lot of them. Over fifty. Tex thought it'd be wise to check them for any trouble, so I put Conroys squad on it."
<br><br>
"The new guy? Guess it's best to break them in. Mmm." The captain sat back, his hat curiously covering his eyes, but not his mustauche.
<br><br>
Dozens of men moved into the pilots lounge, taking off grimy and damaged spacesuits. Marc Simmons moved past them, his hair on end as he walked past the crowd. Something didn't feel right about these guys. But, Marc didn't really care, he got to have more flight time. If he rescued somebody, maybe he'd get to pilot the Gundam again. One time just wasn't enough. He left the lounge, flight helmet in hand, and floated down the hangar bay to his GM.
<br><br>
Once the door to the lounge was closed, Jacobin eyed the crew. He knew several of them, but most were new faces, hired just for this job. He didn't know where Riley found them, but he had a knack for that. It took an awful lot to make a Martian leave his home, after all. The door at the other end of the room opened, and another six and a half foot, blue eyed man moved in, tossing rifles through the air. The armory had just been raided. The Magellans crew accepted the firearms like it was Christmas. But even armed as they were, they wouldn't be doing much of the fighting. They were the backup.
<br><br>
Jacobin and the rest of the Martians pulled long knives into one hand, semiautomatic pistols into the other, and circled in for a prayer.
<br><br>
As the Free Men chanted, the chief of the mercenary strike team pulled a detonator out of his shirt. Inside the hangar, Marc had just left the airlock, and was heading towards the floating debris when the entire Magellan capsule exploded inside the Delphinus, scattering shraphnel and sewing chaos across the entire hangar deck. The whole ship shuddered with the blast, visible from Riley's vantage point.
<br><br>
"That be the signal lassie." The Wraith of the Belt smiled, revving his Doms thrusters.
<br><br>
"What the HELL was that?!" The captain yelled. The girls aboard the bridge were frantic, reports coming from all over the ship.
<br><br>
"Sir, there was a bomb inside the capsule we just took in. Maintenance crews are reporting debris all over the flight deck, we won't be able to launch anything for several minutes."
<br><br>
"Sir! Sensors show two high energy bodies moving towards the fleet. They look like Rick Doms, sir!"
<br><br>
"Captain! I'm not getting anything from deck twelve. Injury reports from every other deck, nothing from deck twelve. I don't understand sir, it wasn't damaged."
<br><br>
The captain pressed his palms together, letting the reports wash over him.
<br><br>
"Alright, it seems we've been had. Lisa, tell everyone to get to battle stations, have the Salamis launch their Balls. Marc and the pods will provide cover fire until the maintenance crews can launch the rest of our GMs. Vanessa, tell them to hurry up, we don't know how many more of the enemy there are."
<br><br>
"Captain." Claudia looked over at her commander. "I just checked security footage from deck twelve. All of the cameras have been shot out sir."
<br><br>
"What?!" The mustauched man went wide eyed. He grabbed his intercom and flipped the global frequency open on his chair.
<br><br>
"This is the captain. We have been boarded. Repeat, we have been boarded."
<br><br>
In his bunk, Tracer smiled like a hyena. He slung himeslf out of bed, and grabbed the biggest shotgun you ever did see off of the wall. He called her Betty.
<br><br>
"AW YEAH SON. TIME TO GRILL ME A MOONFUCK PIE."
<br><br>
On the deck, Otaktai and Issa were floating down the hall, trying to get to the hangar. They turned a corner and were met with gunfire, Wolf barely elbowing his partner and pushing the both of them back behind cover. The two pilots crouched low, looking at each other and unholstering their pistols.
<br><br>
Gunfire came from another end of the hallway, and the Native American swung round and shot. Issa followed him, the two diving between the mercenaries in a mad scramble to get to their mobile suits. The firing was indiscriminate, and there was much confusion about the deck, bullets ricocheting off of walls and not hitting their intended targets. A 9mm greeting card cut into Issas leg, and he cried out before turning around, blasting off return rounds. He struck one of the mercs in the neck.
<br><br>
The two floated away, ignoring the raging battle. The door to the hangar opened, and a floating piece of Magellan came sailing through. The pair barely ducked, looking at the scene of chaos inside the hangar.
<br><br>
"What the hell.." Issas jaw went slack. Maintenance crews scrambled to tie down debris, and get GMs back on their tracks. Weapons had been shot out of lockers and were floating all around. One GM had had its head nearly torn off by its own shield.
<br><br>
"Well don't just stand there!" the ships chief engineer yelled, trying to tie down a piece of flotsom. "Fuckin' help!"
<br><br>
"Addie, ye' go scare up our Salami friends'n I'll handle this 'ere GM!" Riley yelled, aiming his bazooka at Marcs mobile suit. Simmons flew towards the two Doms, machinegun and shield in hand.
<br><br>
"AYE AYE MISTER TOAST! One Minnow roast comin' right up!" Addies Rick Dom blasted off towards the Salamis, swishing up and down as flak screens started spraying through the void. Simmons turned and tried to stop her, but a well placed bazooka shell flew straight past the front of his GMs face. Marc pulled back just in time, turning towards the Wraith.
<br><br>
"Matey, don't you know not to tarry a lady when she's set on doin 'er cookin'." Riley smiled, yellow teeth bespeckling his long beard. He blasted forward, the Dom tumbling in circles as it lurched 360mm shells out of its bazooka. Marc dodged the first, finding that it was just a setup to draw him into the path of the second shell. The round impacted and obliterated his units shield.
<br><br>
"Fuck... This guy's an ace." Marc mumbled. He kicked his thrusters to full, not wasting an ounce of fuel. Using vulcans for suppressive fire, he tried to close the distance and get into saber range.
<br><br>
"That's right dear, come closer, we'll have us a waltz.." Samuel chuckled. He had been practicing for this moment. Countless duels with Radcliffe, Addie and Sayer. Countless days training in the blackness of space. In one fluid motion, he swung the bazooka onto his suits weapons rack with one hand, grabbing a shotgun with the other. Simmons felt something wrong in the nick of time, and blasted his suit upwards just enough that the buckshot only tore apart one of his suits feet.
<br><br>
"Hahahahaha! It's like shooting fish in a barrel. Get it?! Dolphins?! Minnows?!" Addie screamed, her words landing on deaf ears as she poured shells into the side of the Andromeda. Steve was much faster than their greenhorn gunners could manage, and between her two bazookas and four panzer fausts, she had the firepower of a small squadron. A Joiner didn't like to hint, she liked to make things as obvious as she could. A pair of Balls swung round behind her and fired, but she slipped between the two shells, destroying both pods with well placed warheads.
<br><br>
"Fisheggs for me?! You shouldn't have! AHAHAHAHAHA!" Her heart was racing. This was the greatest, the absolute greatest day of her life. The day Mister Toast would get what he deserved. The day they would all be famous. The Gwazines AA guns roared out, pushing her back and away from the fleet. Public Missile boats swung round from the far side, firing missiles on her position. She zigzagged around, dropping a bazooka momentarily and grabbing a panzerfaust. She shot the unruly warhead towards one of the Publics, the round slamming into one of its huge underhanging anti-ship missiles. The detonation was massive, the entire Public going up in smoke. Grabbing hold of her lost bazooka, Joiner moved back into the fray, screaming like a bat out of hell.
<br><br>
The blue eyed demons rushed through the hallways, systematically moving from deck to deck, killing everyone that they found. Jacobin juked right, ducking under machinegun fire. Pulling the trigger to his pistol, he shot out a mans knees before slicing his knife across soft neck tissue. He kicked the still living marine down a corridoor, the man shot by his fellows as his body floated through a hall. Another red moved in, crouching low to the ground and waited. They became silent, like mine-rats just before a dust storm. Two armed marines turned the corner, and were immediately slain.
<br><br>
They came to an open area, and one of the Free Men was shot, over a dozen soldiers guarding the exit at the opposite side. While his body was being filled with bullets the red threw his knife, which lodged efficiently into one defenders skull. Jacobin ducked behind a table, waiting for his chance. He reached behind his shirt, pulling out a pipe bomb and setting a fuse.
<br><br>
Several of Rileys Mercs came in, and started a firefight with the marines. They were too preoccupied to see the bomb slowly float across the room, not making a sound. It went off, filling the area with confusion. A long body raced across the hall, leaping through the air and landing between the marines. The silver knife slashed out, and blood began spraying all over the room. One by one, each of the twelve marines dropped. Three more Martians emerged from around the hall, covered in blood.
<br><br>
Outside the ship, deck by deck, the AA guns ceased firing, gunners laying dead in their chairs. As Jacobins team secured the ship, mercernaries dropped their rifles, starting to work the ship as if it was their own. One AA gun began moving again, only to shred one of the fleets own Balls from behind. Addie sailed around, trails of exhaust following her like a streamer as she battled the entire fleet.
<br><br>
"They're trying to take over the fuckin' ship!" Tex yelled, a huge submachinegun in his hands. "Make sure they don't get to the bridge n' the main guns or this shitstands all over."
<br><br>
One survivor rushed towards the makeshift barricade the Delphinus's finest had set up. They'd taken this ship once, and they would make sure it stayed theirs.
<br><br>
"They were like demons... So fast... I didn't have time to think." The man was shaking, covered in his comrades blood. A lucky pistol shot had killed the martian who had attacked him, after the blue eyed man had singlehandedly killed his entire squad.
<br><br>
"Yeah yeah, pussy faggot elves floatin' around the room in their pussy faggot tutu's." Tracer howled. He had Betty in one hand, an anti tank mine in the other. "I got these fuckers a new dance partner boys. Meet Mr. Claymore."
<br><br>
One deck down, Hazelwood slid under a pair of marines, who tried to shoot at the man in vain. He passed between one mans legs, slashing into his achilles and bounding back up. The marine dropped to his knees, the other swerving around and blasting shells into the air. The Martian Chaplain rolled over the Earthnoids back and shoulders, grabbing his own knife and stabbing him in the eye with it. His own knife gutted the kneeling man. Turning around, Hazelwood met another three reds, who quickly moved forwards. A mercernary dropped his rifle, running for a now free AA gun and kicking the corpse in its chair out of the way.
<br><br>
Out in the void, Marc was simply unable to deal with Riley. If he pulled too far back the Wraith used his bazooka, if he went in too close, the shotgun. His own machinegun didn't have enough ammunition, and Riley was not wasting anything. He simply couldn't fight the pirate on his own.
<br><br>
"If only I had the Gundam..." Simmons hissed. He twirled around in a tight spin, vulcan fire catching a bazooka shell, causing it to explode prematurely. He grabbed his beam saber and shot through the explosion, hoping to catch Riley by surprise. The Wraith responded with his scattering beam gun, Marc covering his eyes for one moment. In that moment, his GM lost an arm.
<br><br>
"Where the hell are you Issa. I need some help!" Marc yelled. He shot back towards the ship, ignoring Addie who, quite literally, was toying with the fleets balls. Riley watched him go, carefully loading another magazine into his bazooka.
<br><br>
"Should be long enough.. I'm sure th'Dolphin 'l let out the welcome matt for ye, you poor sod." Riley laughed. Emil flew towards the Gwazine, but something seemed wrong. He started getting goosebumps, and veered left just as his own ships AA guns turned on him.
<br><br>
"What the hell?!" Simmons yelled. Riley laughed."
<br><br>
"GM three, move to the Andromedas portside crew deck, she will take you in. The Delphinus is compromised, repeat, the Delphinus is compromised." There was a lot of worry in Vanessas voice. The captain looked at her from beneath his bushy demeanor, and sighed.
<br><br>
"Vanessa, send word to the Duke and Andromeda. Order them to train their guns on our engines." He pulled an antique lighter out of a shirt pocket, and began lighting up a cigarette.
<br><br>
"Sir?" The bunnies were in shock.
<br><br>
"At the rate they're cleaning through our decks, we won't make it..." The sly captain began.
<br><br>
"But if Nanaki and Foleys men disable the ship, the Cygnus Fleet may be able to reclaim it." He took a puff off of his cigarette.
<br><br>
"Sir, Nanaki is saying they're unwilling to move any closer with those two Rick Doms out there, and Marcs GM is damaged." Vanessa looked at the captain. The answer, from the other end of the room, came from Lisa.
<br><br>
"Captain, word from the maintenance deck. They're ready to launch the rest of our GMs."
<br><br>
"Excellent. Tell Kobayashi and Wolf to shoot those two skirts out of the sky. And have our gun crews strip their systems, we don't want these bastards to fire on our own ships. If they want to play bloody, we'll give them an eye for an eye." The captain puffed on his cigarette, smoke leasurely finding its way to the top of the Gwazines bridge.
<br><br>
Another Ball exploded, Addie flipping around and reloading her bazookas. The fish tank was her playground, and she was having herself some caviar. She caught something out of the corner of her eye, and dropped altitude just in time to dodge a number of beams. The cavalry had arrived.
<br><br>
"Mister Toast! We've got flags comin' from beneath the waves, starboard aft starboard port!" She yelled, firing a panzerfaust into the crowd. Issa blocked it with his shield, the heavy warhead denting the Gundams shield but doing little real damage.
<br><br>
Riley watched, the wing of GMs spreading around Addie. He dove in after them, firing shotgun rounds into the crowd. GMs broke up, three turning to face the Wraith. Otaktai went in high, firing beams at the Rick Dom, which zigzagged quickly, faking him out. Riley returned the favor with a pair of well placed shotgun rounds, tearing into Wolfs arm and killing one of his wingmen.
<br><br>
Addie ran from Issa and the other pilots, firing her scattering beam gun and bazooka shells to aid her escape. A Light Armor GM approached her from the side, slicing through her 280mm with its beam rifle. The weapon exploded, taking one of the Doms arms with it.
<br><br>
"I'm hit! My dual wield!!" Addie cried. She charged the offending GM, dropping her giant bazooka and grabbing a heat hawk that she had literally duck taped to her Doms shoulder. She sliced the light armor clean in two, turning around and throwing the weapon before moving to pick up her bazooka. Issa blocked the blade, firing his beam rifle at the Dom and pushing her back. AA fire burst out from the Gwazine, forcing him away from his quarry.
<br><br>
"Dammit." Issa grumbled. He aimed carefully for Addie when a bazooka shell hit him in the back. Riley came rushing in, a single GM trailing behind him.
<br><br>
"My pirate in shining armor!" Addie giggled. She caught something out of the corner of her eye and turned, a Saberfish bearing down on her. She fired the remains of her bazooka rounds, one clipping the fish on the wing. It pulled away, but not before firing a number of missiles, managing to take out both of Addies Doms legs. Riley came up to his fellow pirate, grabbing her Rick Dom and pulling it out of harms way. All but disabled, Joiner fired her last panzerfaust into the GMs, the group breaking up and attempting to come at them from all sides. Riley fired a bazooka around, destroying another of the offending MS. It was now two on two, Addie and Riley vs. Otaktai and Issa.
<br><br>
"Hey Mr. Riley." Addie giggled, looking at the note floating about the cockpit. Samuel looked over, blasting his scattering beam gun and pulling the two of them closer to the Gwazine at the same time. They hovered around the ships engines, using the captured AA guns to shield them.
<br><br>
"I was gonna wait n' say this later, but I'm a feelin' it now so..." Addie's throat went dry. She was so nervous.
<br><br>
"Mr. Riley, I-"
<br><br>
Before she finished her sentence, a huge burst of mega particles lanced out, enveloping her Rick Dom. Ashley Joigner was killed instantly, the Dukes mega particle cannons slicing straight through her mobile suit and into the Delphinus's engines. Her reactor melted in an instant, the catastrophic explosion throwing the Wraith and his charred Dom out and into the black void.
<br><br>
The inside of the Gwazine rocked, several marines tumbling off their feet. The reds took advantage, daggers swiftly striking into their guts and necks. Hazelwood and Jacobin met up, Hazelwoods team moving forwards while Jacobins grabbed rifles and moved into covering positions. They were almost to the bridge.
<br><br>
Two Fremen turned the corner, and were met with an absolute hail of shells. They died instantly, Tex, Tracer, and a half a dozen penultimate badasses behind a barricade, preventing the remaining martians from reaching the bridge and the gun decks. The remaining men didn't advance.
<br><br>
"Come on out Dykes, I need to skullfuck someone today!" Tracer laughed, firing a shotgun round against the wall. There was no response. After a few seconds the two reds bodies were dragged back, away from the corner.
<br><br>
"What d'you think they're doing?" Tex said, watching from behind his rifle.
<br><br>
"Fuck, these fucks are savages, they're trying to bury their dead." Someone laughed.
<br><br>
The group was silent for a moment, and then Hazelwood and the rest of his team ran forward, using the bodies of their two fallen comrades as shields. Bullets filled the air on both sides, a pair of men going down next to Tracer, one martian stumbling as buckshot tore into his feet. He kept moving, crawling towards his enemy. They were too small, too lithe, and used the bodies as cover too well.
<br><br>
"Aw fuck this." Tracer said. He dropped Betty, grabbed a pistol and aimed it towards a specific spot on the floor. Hazelwood and his team dropped the bodies and aimed their pistols, but Tracer was a bit faster. He flipped the lot of them the bird, and fired at the claymore mine under their feet.
<br><br>
"BYE FUCKERS!" Magnum blew them a kiss. The mine shot up into the air, detonating and killing Hazelwood and his men summarily. Tracer and Tex got up from behind the barricade and laughed.
<br><br>
"Guess there won't be enough for moonfuck pie, but I bet we can make a moonfuck stew out of these remains!" Magnum was as happy as a school boy. He didn't even notice the knife sailing past, and lodging itself deep in Tex's neck. Jacobin and his men moved quickly, circling through the hallway. Seven of the reds still remained. Jacobin had been just behind Hazelwood and his men, and he was bleeding all over, badly hurt by the mine, but still standing.
<br><br>
"Well. Guess this ain't stardate shithole afterall. It's stardate fuck me in the ass." Tracer whistled. He dropped his pistol. Jacobin lunged at him. At the last second, Magnum grabbed a knife and parried the blow.
<br><br>
"We can do this your way, little elf." 
<br><br>
The two held their blades, circling each other. To the martians, this was a one on one fight, a fight of honor. The rest held their ground, Rileys mercs moving past them and quickly grabbing the controls to the capital guns at the far end of the deck.
<br><br>
Jacobin Conroy and Tracer Magnum stared each other down, slowly coming closer and closer, breathing in and out slowly. Jacobin was much taller than Tracer, but Magnum was the heavier man, not having been damaged by decades of malnutrition. The air became thick, foggy, anticipation and suspense running its course through the room.
<br><br>
Something in one of them snapped, an instant of weakness, and both soldiers moved like lightning. Their blades rang out, silver streaks slicing through the filtered air. They stopped opposite each other, blood on both of their blades. For a moment their was silence, and then Tracer Magnum fell to the floor.
<br><br>
"Fffuck Yoou..." He gasped, blood burbling out of his neck. Soon he was dead. Jacobin collapsed on the side of the wall, the knife and mine wounds finally overcoming him. Knowing he would be all right for the time being, the rest of Rileys Free Men moved to the bridge.
<br><br>
Issa and Otaktai were moving for Riley when the final order of the captain of the Delphinus was carried out. A single white flare shot into the sky over the Gwazines bridge, the sign for retreat. Issa pulled back, he and Otaktai moving for cover and away from the Gwazines devastating guns.
<br><br>
"Lets get the hell out of here, we've shredded their engines enough. All ships, turn 180 degrees and move ahead flank speed!" Nanaki yelled. His helmsman moved into action, and the Duke sailed away from the engagement. Andromeda moved to match his course, when a pair of MPC lances the size of mobile suits shot through its midsection. One of the Gwazines primary guns was still operational.
<br><br>
"All hands brace for impact!" Nanaki yelled. The Andromeda exploded, a valiant fireball tearing through the ship.
<br><br>
"Arm anti-beam missiles and use them to cover our tail till we get out of range, fast!" Kai yelled. His crew complied, the Duke dropping missiles like mines behind it to give it enough time to get out of the way. Thirty seconds later another blast shot out of the Dolphin, but it dissipated on the sparkling chaff. The ship now belonged to the pirates.
