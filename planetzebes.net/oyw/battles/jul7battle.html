<br>
Most people underestimate how much open space is available within the interior of most colonies.  Otherwise, Derek Carter mused, how would they have found all this nice open space to park their mobile suits in and still have enough room to simulate combat?  The Guncannon set down with a crunch, destroying a meticulously cared for tree with one of his mobile suit's feet.
<br><br>
"Okay, paint rounds are loaded.  Going live in five," Jack Murphy stated as his GM Command set down and destroyed what appeared to be a small child's wooden playhouse.  A green light was all the acknowledgement he recieved from his fellow pilot.  At an unspoken "go" command, both mobile suits leapt into action...

<br>
The melee that occurred in that brief five minutes can only be described as horrific.  In the blink of an eye, several acres of forest were utterly annihilated.  Parks used for the recreation and relaxtion of a hard-working populace reduced to splinters and pulp in the leaping and running both Federal mobile suits performed in their "Simulated Combat".  The effects of the large, mobile suit grade paint pellets was no better.  Trees were snapped in half upon impact, large areas of land now stained in bright yellows, greens, and blues.  In all, the damages were estimated in the tens of thousands, potentially more.  The only factor working the favor of the two Federal pilots was that nobody was in the park on this day.
<br><br>
As the two Federal pilots were taken from the scene in handcuffs, the Federal authorities already beginning the process of removing their property from the scene, Jack muttered bitterly.
<br><br>
"There's a damn war on, and they don't want us to keep our fighting edge... just wait until they see the Zeon up close.  They'll be sorry..."
<br><br>
"You're just mad because I beat you.." came a reply from nearby.  Jack turned his head quickly toward his fellow pilot and glared.<br>
<br><br>
Beside him, Derek Carter simply stared at a bird as it flew from the scattered remains of it's former habitat.
