<br>
The AU are still alive and kicking for the most part. This time this lone truck has a lone escort. The AU hopes this one makes it... but not if JAF Bravo has anything to say about it.
<br><br>

<br>
The JAF Bravo pilots notice the two blips on their radars. They fire a salvo of missiles at the two targets and the truck and its escort go up in a fury of flames as they both exploded. Char sat there and chuckles as the fires raged on from the explosions.

"Did you hear something?" A bewildered mechanic looked at his fellow crewman, wondering where the noise was coming from as the fleet of Gaws soared high above the North American deserts on its way to Jaburo. The rest of the crew could now hear a low buzzing noise, just barely drowned out by the massive engines of the four gaws. 
<br><br>
"AAAAWWW! ITS SO CUTE!" squealed one of the Dopp pilots as they looked out one of the windows. She pointed emphatically at the small aircraft that was trying to reach them, powered by a single propeller. 
<br><br>
"..." A group of pilots behind her paused for a second, then burst out into laughter at the sight of the rather insignificant plane. "What IS that?!"
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Sir, we have one signature just behind us, and a single signature following our course on the ground." A radar tech looked up from his console as he relayed the information to Garma. The young Zabi rolled his eyes, waving his hand dismissively to mobilize the fighters to dispatch of the annoyance.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"What is th..." The truck drive looked up to try and spot the lone Dragonfly type aircraft that the AU managed to deploy. Much to his dismay all he could see was a hail of bombs falling from the sky. Within moments the truck was nothing more than debris and a crater in the ground.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Oh shi-" The pilot of the African Union plane's eyes widened as he watched a payload of bombs drop from the belly of the rear most Gaw. He paused for a moment before looking towards the ground to see if there was any sign that his comrade had survived. After seeing the arid desert erupt in a barrage of explosions, he knew there was no chance he made it out alive. 
<br><br>
"Hello there!" The young girl in a pink Dopp smiled excitedly as she now brought her fighter face to face with the antique jet. Behind her was a squad of about 30 more Dopps. 
<br><br>
"Eep~!" The African Union pilot almost crapped himself as he took in the mass of Duchy fighters that opposed him; Maybe they had bit off more than they could chew...
<br><br>
"But... But... But..." and before he could say anything else, the Dragonfly exploded in a cloud of dust, leaving the young girl pouting as the "cute little aeroplane" disappeared from sight. 
<br><br>
"Aw, I wanted to keep it..." She jutted out her lower lip and whimpered as they squads of Dopps returned to their hangars.
