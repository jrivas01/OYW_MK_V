Our story begins as a lone African Union truck was driving along the coast looking for a way to get into the Pacific Ocean. The driver of the truck was humming away random notes as time was going by. He didn't know it but his days of fun ion the sun was about to come to an explosive end.

<br>
The Green Jaguars were patrolling when one of them noticed movement along the coastal line. The Zaku that saw the blip on its radar fired its machine gun at the blip. A few seconds later the African Union truck blows up. Pretty proud of itself the Zaku pilot celebrated his victory inside of his cockpit while moving back into formation with the other members of his team.

<br>
<b>U.S. Border Patrol... Somewhere on the border of Canada and the U.S.</b>
<br><br>
"Halt! who goes there?!" A marine carrying a gun walks out of his little guard shack and looks at the driver. He looked over the caravan of trucks, then back to the head driver; what were a caravan of african trucks doing, coming from Canada...
<br><br>
"Sir, we just wanted to get into the country..."
<br><br>
"Damn canadians...I need passport, I.D., Social Security Card, Blood Sample, Highschool Diploma, and 20 bucks wouldn't hurt." The guard chuckled as the truckers began grumbling. 
<br><br>
As the truckers got together to try and scrounge up some money, a silenced pistol took out the guard, and was quietly replaced by another, eerily similar soldier. The truckers looked back suspiciously as the new guard adjusted the strap on his gun, quickly returning their attention to the task at hand; collecting toll.
<br><br>
"What is taking you all so long..." The lone guard mused, catching the impatient trucker's attention. They all glared at the marine, the other thirty plus marines shuffled in behind them while they weren't looking. 
<br><br>
With a high pitched whistle and laugh, the "border guard" pointed to the 55th Armored's squad of marines that had materialized behind the poor truckers. They slowly turned around, letting out a huge sigh simultaneously as they held their hands in the air; they KNEW they should have just ran the border...

<br>
"Slowly... slowly..." The foreman guided the crane carefully as it moved the last of the Armored trucks into the crusher. He gave the signal for the crane operator to drop the vehicle, the truck slamming into the compactor, kicking up a cloud of dust as it thudded against the metal. With great enthusiasm, he pushed the button, starting the machine; the trucks crumpled under the pressure, and were left in a pile of scrap.
