<br><br>
With the task of taking out the Federation's 42nd Fleet in the hands of the TAF officer, Ando Shoji, Novosad set his sights westward. He was instructed by Gihren, along with the other Schutzstaffel naval force to engage the Federation's naval fleets. The Jukon U-99 had put some distance between itself and the mess that was Manila, and Ritter Novosad was all too relieved to be away from such a failed campaign. He and Xavier Brennan had been assigned by Lord Gihren to assure the mission's success, but much to their dismay, second Lieutenant Shoji had botched the job up beyond their salvaging. 
<br><br>
"Keep a steady depth, all hands at the ready, we are entering enemy waters..." The Schutzstaffel officer watched the radar grid carefully, his red eyes glowing with an almost eerie aura, as he counted down entry into the Federation water space. "...Now." The lights on the <i>U-99</i> dimmed, and were followed with a low red glow of the emergency lights. All able hands on the submarine were alert and waiting patiently as they ventured into hostile waters.
<br><br>

<br><br>
"Eddy, this is Dish 01..." An electronic voice came over the Federation airwaves, the transmission littered with static. The Hillock's Dish flew high above the waves, scanning the waters below.  "We've located an unidentified signature entering Federation waters."
<br><br>
"Confirmed, Dish 01. This is the 31st anti-submarine wing, our radar has picked up a Zeon Submarine in the waters." The Dish of the <i>31st wing</i> responded to the radio chatter as it circled above the waters just west of the Federation's Eddy. 
<br><br>
The waves broke against the bow of the Hillock as its speed increased. Sirens rang loudly across the waters as the deck of the ship came to life, pilots rushing to their stations as they readied to engage the enemy vessel. The sea seemed to violently erupt as Don Escargots littered the waters with ASW bombs and depth charges, trying to direct the Jukon towards their destroyer. The sky seemed to come alive minutes later as the <i>118th fighter division</i> arrived to support the two Federation patrols. 
<br><br>
"He's diving! coerce him into range, we need to get a firing solution with our torpedoes." The bridge of the <i>Eddy</i> radioed to their aerial support as they kept their radar active, waiting for a firing solution.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
The dull red lights on the <i>U-99</i> flashed to life, strobing brightly as the sirens blared through out the vessel. The Panzergrenadier's eyes seemed to flash as he jerked his head about to see his radar screen riddled with enemy aircraft. "Who let this happen?!" Novosad stood abruptly as he began barking orders. He motioned to his men to be ready, only using a few hand signals and a frightening glare from behind his ruby goggles. 
<br><br>
"Sir, I'm counting three full Federation patrols..." The man operating the radar board spun around in his seat, his glasses sliding down his nose as he came to face the intimidating Unterscharfuhrer. The young man seemed to swallow his tongue as he gulped anxiously before continuing. "If my information is correct, its the Eddy, supported by the 118th Fighter Division and the 31st Anti Submarine wing sir. We don't have the fire power to make a fight of this."
<br><br>
Ritter grimaced under his helmet as he cursed under his breath. The submarine began to rock violently as depth charges detonated all around his ship. The soldier was right in his assessment, as much as he hated to admit it, they may have won the day, but he was not about to let them get off the hook with out a few parting gifts. The enraged Schutzstaffel agent slammed his fists on the computer in front of him, causing sparks and smoke to fill the area. 
<br><br>
After taking a few seconds to calm himself, he looked to one of his gunners. "Fire the missiles, prepare for retreat... They can have this, we'll try to find another way through to their waters..." Not seconds after the orders left his mouth, the silos opened up, and the surface came to life as bubbles rushed to the surface, followed shortly by rockets hurtling forth from the depths. Two tin cods from the <i>118th Fighter Division</i> got caught in the explosion of one, sending the planes crashing into the waves below, while the others just caused the aerial units to disperse, allowing the <i>U-99</i> to retreat back to the depths, away from the Federation waters.

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>The Horsemans Banquet gets pulled over</b></font></center>
<br><br>
The Horsemans Banquet glided calmly through space, as it went on it's way. Within the bridge of the ship seated in the Captains chair was the lovely Maharah Villina. Her state of dress would draw stares, as her long slender legs fit wonderfully in the tight black pants she wore.Which ended with the stylish stiletto heels she had. Her incredible bust was held up in an invigorating manner by a cute blue corset. Her head was currently titled to the right forcing her long hair to cascade like silk down her shoulder. "Did you say their was a contact?" she asked, directing her question towards the comm station
<br><br>
The man stationed at the comm center across the bridge looked up. "Yes Captain. I'm getting multiple solid contacts approaching the ship." he said in a rush. At hearing this others around the bridge looked up from their stations, nervousness plain on their faces.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Maharah leaned forward slightly. "Remain calm, it's likely a Zeon patrol, so have our credentials ready." she said softly to the comms man. He nodded quickly and began to fumble with his console. Maharah glanced around the bridge. "None of you need worry. We will be fine." She said ever so softly. Though her words had the desired effect and one could feel the mood improve on the bridge.
<br><br>
Within a minute six Zaku's came into sight and began orbiting the transport craft. The most notable Zaku was decked out in a dark green with gold embroidered around the suit. 
<br>
<br>
On the bridge the small view screen located near the front of the bridge by the comm station came to life. A man appeared on the screen. His chin looked as if it was chiseled from stone, his face was fiercely set and his hair looked down right dignified. His booming voice called with a thunder clap. "This is Admiral Dozal Zabi. You have violated Zeon space. Identify your ship now or you will be fired upon."
<br>
<br>
Maharah quickly responded. "We are transmitting our identification now Admiral. Please sand by."  Seconds passed and seemed to stretch into hours for the crew of the Horsemans Banquet. Ever Maharah felt a tinge of nervousness enter her mind.
<br>
<br>
Dozals face once again appeared on the screen. "This seems to be in order. Take care to follow our laws while you our in Zeon space." and with that the screen went blank and the six Zaku's peeled off of the ship allowing it into Zeon space.
