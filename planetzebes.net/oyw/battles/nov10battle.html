<br>
Waves washed over the deck of the <i>U-99</i> as it surfaced along the coast of Tunsia, water cascading off its metal hull. The sun shimmered off the metallic surface of the sub as it leveled out and came to a slow cruising speed. The captain of the Medea grinned as he saw his target breach the surface. "Bring Chicken Little around, send the flares for the Don Escargots to rally on this point." The Captain was quite proud of himself, he was going to rid himself of this Zeon nuiasance once and for all.
<br><br>
Ritter stared into the sky as he exited the hatch atop the bridge. The sun glared across his goggles, but the ruby lenses allowed him to see the Federation aircraft circling above him. He grumbled as a flare exited the rear of the plane, scanning the surrounding skies for what the signal was summoning. Realizing there was nothing in the area, he returned his gaze back to the enemy craft.
<br><br>
<i>Damn Feddie whore is out of range... what a shame...</i>
<br><br> 
The Newtype Schutzstaffel agent scowled as he leveled his rifle and fired a few shots into the air out of curiousity. Rewarded with nothing but the bullets falling far short, he climbed down onto the deck of his boat and proceeded to march towards the bow. The salt water seemed to coalesce on his blackened armor, the waves spraying him as they crashed against the side of the <i>U-99</i>. He came to a stop at the end of the deck, a huge wave broke, sending a wall of water behind him as he stood staring defiantly at the <i>Chicken Little</i>

"Sir..."
<br><br>
"Yessss?"
<br><br>
"Ummm, the two wings of Don Escargot's we requested are unable to make it into the Zeek Airspace..." The pilot turned around to look back at his commander. The young captain seemed to turn white as he realized his mistake, an almost animated look of disbelieve fell across his face as he slumped his shoulders.
<br><br>
<i>Ooooh, I hope he doesn't tell Nigel about this... how embarassing...</i>
<br><br>
He looked up at the pilot and gave him a glare. The pilot nodded and went back to circling the enemy vessel. "Drop us close enough so he can see us... Then let us leave this place." The pilot silently brought the plane into a descent as the back hangar opened up. The man tied himself off and stepped out onto the platform, staring down at the enemy Schutzstaffel agent. He waved his fist in the air defiantly, and almost in a comedic fashion, as the <i>Chicken Little</i> began to retreat.
<br><br>
"What a strange man..." The red eyes of Ritter Novosad stared emotionlessly at the retreating vessel, shaking his head before turning around and marching back to the tower. He had repairs that needed to be done, but one day he'd get that man: Gihren will be most pleased...
