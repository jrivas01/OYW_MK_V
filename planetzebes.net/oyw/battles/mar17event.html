Seldomly is it this quiet so close to the battlelines of the EFSF and the Zeon space force.  Plagued by constant combat and now pirate activity, this region of space is now a guantlet for the crews of small ships and shuttles.
<br><br>
But today will be a quiet day for the crew of the <i>Prince of Aargau</i>.  As the transport craft made its way to its destination, off-duty crew members passed the time in the messhall.
<br><br>
As playing cards are dealt out, one of them remarked," So a babe named Mahara Villina sold us to a Zeek chick named Nadia Adelaide..
<br><br>
"Yep," agreed his buddy as he inspected his cards.
<br><br>
"... Who then sold us to another chick Emil Myberg and finally to a lady named Veronica Wu."
<br><br>
"Dude," corrected his buddy," Emil is a guy."
<br><br>
"Hell no, it's a girl's name.  Like short for Camille.  It's a chick I tell ya."
<br><br>
"You're messed up in the head.  Pair o' queens."
<br><br>
"Pair kings."
<br><br>
"Go to hell."
<br><br>

Hours later, the <i>Prince of Aargau</i> floated into the middle of the debris field.  Formerly known as "Purgatorio", this Zeon base was utterly destroyed by the Federal fleet called the Damocles Strike Force.  That fleet in term ceased to be shortly after.
<br><br>
As the GM-Es kept guard, the surveyors continued on their search through the ruins.  They soon report that a Makeshift HQ can be erected here for future Zeon operations.  In fact, they even found hangar modules that survived the base's destruction.  It took most of the night, but by then there are Zeon personnel in Purgatorio once more.
