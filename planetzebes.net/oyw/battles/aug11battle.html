Jaburo didn't really look the way it used to. Jim tried to recall his training days, which seemed such a long time ago. Before the war began, when he was but a simple cadet, learning to be a fighter pilot. These jungles had been lush then, full of green and life.
<br><br>
While it took more than a few fires to put out the Amazon rainforest entirely, a square mile or so surrounding Jaburo proper still looked a fiendish hellscape, a sight that made Irwin frown. So many people had died in this war, and so many parts of the Earth had been scarred. While Zeon had constructed this injustice towards the natural world, the Earth Federation had been responsible for many similar situations.
<br><br>
As he sailed his damaged Tin Cod onto one of the surviving airstrips, Jim wondered what command had in store for him. They said they were transferring him to the Test Corps, giving him some new weapon. He didn't really like mobile suits, and he'd voiced his disapproval, but word was they'd made something special, just for him.
<br><br>
He was about to find out just how special it was.

In the orbit around the Earth stand two members of Zeon's Mobile Assault Force. One of them is sitting there in her GM Command while the other is sitting in her Zaku II Manipulator Type. Corporal Haifa floats in a stable orbit  as she sees her fellow MAF comrade drifting towards her. The Zaku II Manipulator Type inches closer to her intended target. The newtype machine and its pilot, Persephone ready for battle.

<br>
As per the previous arrangement moth mobile suits display a countdown timer. They had agreed to see who can beat who in a time span of 15 minutes. Both female pilots were confident that they would win, but the person with the most skill would win this day. If people were to bet on this fight they would bet on the Zaku II Manipulator type, because of the newtype pilot and the 4 manipulator arms. Still though some would bet on the Zeon controlled GM Command because appearances are not so transparent of combat abilities during times of war.
<br><br>

<br>
The timer started to count down as the pilots moved their mobile suits at each other. The GM Command withdrew its beam saber and went in for a close range combat tactic. Persephone equipped her Zakus two manipulator arms with the puncher shield and a heat hawk. She used her newtype powers to move the manipulator arms to combat the GM Command.

<br>
The two mobile suits melee weapons clashed the fight seemed even until the two pilots locked their melee weapons together to see which one was the best and strongest. That is when Persephone maneuvered her manipulator arm that had the shield to bash it against the chest of the GM Command. The mobile suit rocked back some as Haifa cursed inside of her unit. She then pulled out her beam gun and started to fire it franticaly at the Zaku II Manipulator. Some of the beams hit toe of the arms. The suit lost its heat hawk and another one of the unused arms. This sent Persephone into a fit of rage as she charged forth using the shield as a battering ram.

<br>
The GM Command boosts away from the charging Zaku II firing head vulcans at it. The bullets bounce off of the shield as the Zaku pilot continues her berserker attack against the GM Command. Right as Haifa pulled the trigger on her Beam gun the shield hit the tip of it forcing a violent explosion to happen which sent the GM command spinning and leaving the Zaku II stunned for a while. During the spinning the GM Command still held onto its beam saber as it grazed the side of the Zaku's waist. The cut wasn't deep but it was just enough to cut power to the Zaku. As Haifa pulled herself together she noticed that they had 2 minutes left. She sighed in relief as she carried the de-powerd newtype machine back to base.
