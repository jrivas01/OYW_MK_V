<br>
Morale is high in the Earth Federal Ground Forces.  The breathtaking victories of the Odessa offensive followed by the successful defense at the Battle of Jaburo gave proof that the Earth Federation is not at the complete mercy of the Duchy of Zeon.  There are now rumors through the ranks that the Federation can reverse their earlier failures and push all the way into the Zeon homeland of Side 3.
<br><br>
The more wiser of the EFGF realize the challenges before they can meet such a goal.  While beaten, the surviving Zeon forces on Earth are still strong enough to resist and even inflict damage upon the Earth Federation.  The day have gotten a little brighter for the EFGF but they are not in the clear yet.
<br><br>

<br>
This is the reality that the Hillock-class <i>Eddy</i> and the 31st Anti-Submarine Wing awoke to.  Under the bright midday sun in the Atlantic Ocean, the two EFGF patrols converge on what their sonar equipment identified as enemy submarines.
<br><br>
Standartenfuhrer Sebastian Brennan steps onto the bridge of the <i>U-18 Merlin</i> with his usual scrowling face.
<br><br>
"Give me a situation report," he growled at the nearest officer.
<br><br>
"Sir, the Sealance from the <i>Pendragon</i> reported air units and a Hillock closing in on our position.  Captain Nimue is bringing her ship around to confront the Hillock.  She is moving the fleet around to set up a torpedo trap for the ship.  Alec Irusk and Gil Krundel are already deployed with their MS teams to confront the air units."
<br><br>
Brennan gave a rare approving nod.  "Very well then, let's follow lady's lead.  For the glory of Zeon, move out!"
<br><br>

<br>
The Don Escargots of the 31st Anti-Submarine Wing discharged their first stick of depth charges with professional attention.  These pilots are aware of the long and tedious process of forcing an underwater target into an improvised killzone.  The advantage will go to whoever has the first initiative in ASW combat. Unfortunately, for the Federal aircraft, their Zeon adversaries struck first. 
<br><br>
Lieutenant Alec Irusk leaped out of the water, with both of his rapid-fire mega particle cannons at the ready.  The sudden appearance of the Z'Gok E caught two of the Don Escargots in the middle of a long and predictable sonar buoy pattern. Each plane was instantly vaporized by a different hand of the Z'Gok E.  All around the 31st Anti-Submarine Wing, a half dozen marine mobile suits ambushed the low flying Federal aircraft.  Acquys and Z'Goks alike opened fire without remorse on the surprised planes. 
<br><br>
However, there are already depth charges and torpedoes in the water.  Sebastian Brennan held on to a handrail as the <i>U-18 Merlin</i> shook from a series of close explosions.  Fortunately the damage report showed that only superficial damage was done to the outer hull.  Back on the surface, the Hillock-Class <i>Eddie</i> is racing to reload and fire off another round of torpedoes and depth charges.  
<br><br>
The STFU is not going to allow that.  Sergeant Gil Krundel in his marine mobile armor, the Grabro, opened fire first with his anti-ship torpedoes.  From all sides, the <i>Eddie</i> is surrounded by torpedoes from Jukon IIs and Mad Angler-Class submarines.  A series of terrific explosions and shockwaves transform the gunship into a twisted piece of metal that vaguely represents a warship.  For half a moment, it seemed as if the fatally wounded ship would not sink.  That is, until Gil Krundel wrapped the large claws of the Grabro around the doomed ship and pulled it apart like a wishbone at Thanksgiving.  
<br><br>
The once blue Atlantic Ocean is now a painting of metal fragments, debris, and increasingly growing oil slick.  After a few cautious minutes, to make sure there are no more Federal patrols around them, the Zeon marine mobile suits returned to the ships of the STFU fleet.  The STFU then proceeded to GTFO while saying one last BRB to their ATF choice of battlefields:
