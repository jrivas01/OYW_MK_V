Just outside of Granada, on the rocky shores of the barren and lifeless moon, Kycillia Zabi watched the test. They were in a small atmospheric enclosed buggy, the huge mobile armor towering over them. The Earth was currently between the moon and the sun, and the dark shadows added to the overall secrecy of the event.
<br><br>
"See if she can move five at once." Dr. Flanagan said, the small man watching as the green, hat shaped mobile armor floated above. Another bit dropped out of its backside, joining its four brothers in a mysterious dance above. One by one test dummies and other targets were found and pinned with mega particles, pink lances of energy lightening the dark lunar surface.
<br><br>
"She's doing better than expected... Soon she'll be ready for combat." Kycillia watched with awe. "Where did we find her again?"
<br><br>
"Side six my lady. Baldur Bey." Flanagan mused, thinking of the day when Char Aznable himself had brought her in. She was so young then..
<br><br>
"It seems that our technology is finally catching up with your research doctor." Kycillia smiled. As they watched the show, the other mobile weapon being tested floated into the lifeless field. This one was only half finished, a color to match Granadas soil, and more humanoid in shape. Flanagan gave a set of commands to the pilot, and one of the machines two arms dropped off its body, floating on a wire throughout the test site.
<br><br>
"By the way my lady.. I heard your men intercepted word of a Federation anti-newtype project.." Flanagan looked at the masked woman, Kycillia glaring at him for a moment.
<br><br>
"I have sent my best team after it. Jinyuan is dead, but his men are still capable of executing plans on the most limited resources." Kycillia had mixed feelings about Jinyuan. She absolutely abhorred the man, but there was little she could hate in regards to his track record.
<br><br>
"We will destroy the Federations Phantom project, and make our Newtype battalion a reality." As she spoke, a flare of light from the Elmeths mega particle beams cut across the Zeongs face, illuminating the deadly mobile weapon.
<br><br>
"And then, old friend. Then this long war will end in a single stroke."
