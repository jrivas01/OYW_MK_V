Making a decent honest living is most difficult during times of war.  Before the war that is to be known as the One Year War began, a lively traffic of resource shuttles ran the circuit between Earth and to wherever humanity set foot upon.  It was good business because where humans go, they must bring home with them.
<br><br>
This industry must continue even when the circuit became less of a delivery route and more of a hazardous guantlet.  Death is more probable but the crews still keep going.
<br><br>
Such is the story of the Cargo Transport Craft-class <i>Horseman's Banquet</i>.  Her captain, the sexy and manipulative Mahara Villina, and the crew had their share of fortune and failures.  
<br><br>
They provided a safe haven for the then-EFSF-pilot Emil Myberg so that he can seek sanctuary in Side 6.  Villina was also able to play both sides of the war by selling merchandise to Zeon and bribing her way through Earth Federal blockade fleets.  Even in hard times, Villina proved to be a survivor.  Captured by the Pirates of Black Rock, she managed to earn her freedom and once again start over from scratch.
<br><br>
But that chance is about to end.
<br><br>

She was going over their manifest of Air and water containers when the bridge contacted her in alarm.  Bursting on the bridge, Villina's crew began shouting at her.
<br><br>
"We have a mobile suit closing in along with a shuttle!"
<br><br>
"Are they Zeon?" asked Villina," Earth Federal Forces?"
<br><br>
"Damn, I don't know!  Wait... it's a Zaku II!"
<br><br>
"It doesn't matter now," hissed Villina as she remembered the time Samuel Riley's Rick Dom buzzed her ship," increase to full speed!  Get us out of here!  We stop for no one!"
<br><br>

<br>
It is the perfect job for Malak Lazarevich.  The gun-for-hire love simple things and nothing was simpler than stopping an unarmed transport.  A couple of flybys, buzz the bridge, and maybe fire some warning shots to convince more determined crews.  But that's really all he should need to do.
<br><br>
"<i>Hey lazy Lazarevich!</i>" taunted the pilot in the shuttle behind him," <i>you going to stop that transport or not?</i>"
<br><br>
"Shut your trap," retorted Lazarevich," I'm working on it!"
<br><br>
The damn cargo transport isn't slowing down.  He did all he could and brought the Zaku II F as close to the transport as he dared without crashing into it.
<br><br>
"Aw, to hell with this!"
<br><br>
In one motion, the 120mm machinegun came up and bullets began flying.  Lazarevich was sure a show of force would do the trick.  But his bad luck just got worse.
<br><br>
The pilot at the controls of the <i>Horseman's Banquet</i> flinched and jerked the cargo transport in what was supposed to be a sorry excuse for an evasive manuever.  What ended up happening was the <i>Horseman's Banquet</i> flying straight into Lazarevich's warning shots.  The huge 120mm rounds puncture and ate their way into the thin hull of the ship and within a few moments, Lazarevich's prize blew up in his face.
<br><br>
The force of any ship exploding at close range can hurt anyone and Lazarevich's Zaku II F is baffled by the sudden explosion.  Then to his disbelief, there is nothing left of the ship but some floating scraps of metal.
<br><br>
"Aaaaaaahh, CRAP," he muttered.
