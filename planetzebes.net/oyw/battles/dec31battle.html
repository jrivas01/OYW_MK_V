<br>
A man of slight build and vested in rich fineries marched down a long white corridor, the walls lined from one end to the other with red tapestries bearing golden tassles.  He approached a beautiful antique wooden door, dark with age and stains, and standing at the door were two Zeon soldiers, armed with heavy rifles and elite training. The man, blonde and tall, stood before the door while the guards saluted him and opened the door. Instead of the small room, lit and warmed by a crackling fire that the doors would seem to seal, the man entered a gigantic, darkly lit hangar; and it too was lined with red tapestries, bearing the white and black emblem of Zeon and the Zabi family.

At one of end of the room was a wooden pedastal, and as the man climbed it and made his way to the center, he passed chairs flanking a central podium, and on one of those chairs was Yuji Takeshi. He was well dressed in the uniform of the Schutzstaffel, and he wore new pins on his jacket, pins fitting of an <i>Oberschutze</i>. Before the podium sat dozens upon dozens of folding metal chairs, filled with Zeon soldiers, officers, and mechanics alike. As the blonde man reached the podium, a wave of sound murmurred across the crowd. Then he began to speak.

<br>
"Gentlemen! We are here to behold the fruits of our labor, the results of months of blood, sweat, and tears, and years of Federation oppression!" As he spoke, a light far above and behind him slowly faded into life, red and menacing, and the crowd roared in celebration. He continued. "The Sahalin family has suffered much to create the ultimate weapon, a weapon that will change the war completely, a weapon that will change our future completely!" The light grew yet brighter, casting twisted shadows on something behmoth and monstrous beneath it. "Through our suffering may come victory, and through our victory, we will become legends! That will be the legacy of Ghinius Sahalin!" To Ghinius' right, Yuji Takeshi felt the cold satisfaction of looming victory. He looked over his shoulder as the crowd continued to roar in defiance towards any who would oppose them.

<i>My Apsalus, my Apsalus... II. You are beautiful.</i> Sick and deformed shapes played across thick metal as the eye moved back and forth, the Zaku type gasmask face lending the machine the appearance of a storm trooper, and a gaping, black cavity sat in the middle of the thing, unlit by the dim lights of the hangar or by the light cast by the mono-eye. It was the abyss, and the Federation would be fighting the abyss.

Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you.
<center><b>Outcome: The Apsalus Project nears completion</b>
<br>Yuji Takeshi - 1 VP gained, Promoted to Oberschutze</center>
