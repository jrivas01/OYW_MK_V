<br>
If there is one sector of the Earth Sphere that can be considered safe, it would be the Riah Republic.  Occupying the Side 6 region of space, the Riah Republic had done an amazing job of avoiding the fate of other colonie bunches who got caught up in the One Year War.
<br><br>
The state of neutrality that shield the Riah Republic from harm is a very fragile one.  Only by mutual inconvienence and agreement were the forces of the Federation and the Duchy of Zeon prevented from clashing at Side 6.  The meager military force of the Riah Republic are aware of this and their patrol garrisons are constantly vigilant.  Each day they patrol the perimeter, ready to shepherd lost EF and Zeon military units away from Side 6.
<br><br>

<br>
One of those times would be today, as Officer Candidate Cassandra Elaine Beckett found out.  The daughter of a wealthy JDEG investor guides her Guncannon MPT from the edge of Side 2 towards the Riah Republic in Side 6.  Her life since her arrive at the "2 Days from Earth" battleline had been busy.  There was the fleet action against the Zeon Expeditionary Force and now this clandestine mission behind Zeon lines...
<br><br>
"What the?" asked Cassandra outloud as she pulled the Guncannon MPT back.
<br><br>
A group of readings appeared on her scanners.  It took another few kilometers before Beckett's computer were able to identify them.  She groaned at the computer.
<br><br>
"<i>Federal mobile suit, this is Riah Patrol...</i>" crackles the radio, "<i>Change your course bearing and follow our formation.</i>"
<br><br>
Beckett looked at her forward monitor.  Sure enough, a Riah Patrol Boat flanked by Torieres fighter craft are headed toward her.  Off in the distance, more signals emerge.  Doubtlessly reinforcements.
<br><br>
In all honesty, Beckett could probably destroy the entire Riah Patrol force by herself.  But she knew better than that.
<br><br>
With a final sigh, the EFSF pilot signaled to the Riah patrols that she is complying.  Soon her mobile suit is escorted away from the direction of the Riah Republic.
