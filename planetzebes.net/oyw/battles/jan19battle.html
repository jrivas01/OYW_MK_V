Between enemy encounters and rouge transports the Ohm Fleet spotters had gotten a lot of action lately. Today would prove to be no different. "I've got something." yelled a spotter on the bridge of the Titan. The bridge crew immediately went into action attempting to identify the ship.
<br><br>
"Enemy?" asked the XO glancing slightly at Ohm who appeared uninterested so far. Seconds stretched on the bridge until the spotter replied. "Negative, it's a cargo transport. It looks to be the one from last time." The XO glanced at Ohm again.
<br><br>
Ohm shifted in his seat as he considered it for a moment. "Inform the transport, civilian traffic is currently blocked in this area. The transport is to turn around or it will be fired upon." he said. The XO nodded and ordered the message sent. "Move the fleet into their path as well." he said.

<br>
"What do you mean turn back!" yelled John. The bridge crew glanced nervously back at him. This would be there third encounter with the Federation fleet recently.
<br><br>
"How can he do this. We just made a deal the other day." fumed John. But with the entire Ohm fleet ahead of him he had no choice but to order his ship to turn around. "Turn us back." he said.

"Raaargh!"
<br><br>
Ando ran and ran, but the distant sparkle of light never grew any larger as he made his way down the dark corridor. He ran and ran, and the corridor seemed only to get longer; already he felt as though he had run from one end of a colony to the other. His footfalls echoed off the gray walls and he noted how they were the only sounds he could hear. No sounds of machinery, no sounds of life; he was alone, save for the hairy old geezer who was probably too senile to pay the electricity bill.
<br><br>
Something flashed in the darkness.
<br><br>
Knives buried themselves in the wall and floor where And had stood a moment before, but the shiny weapons had given themself away, and he had jumped out of the way. He raged at the corridor again, not because of the length this time, but because of the frustrating darkness.
<br><br>
"Who's there?! Shit, I can't see!"
<br><br>
More metal glinted in the umbral twilight, a flurry of knives seeking out Aldo's flesh, but they met only the back of his hand, and they fell to the floor, dejected, with a comparitively deafening clatter. Aldo regained his footing, planting himself into a battle stance, tensing his muscles in preparation of the next attack. Behind him, though, a new opponent was edging towards him with a curved sword in his hands.
<br><br>
The swordsman swung at Aldo's neck, but the Brave Zeonic Paragon of Justice(r) ducked out of the way, and the sword cut a neat gash through the metal plating on the wall that extended three feet into the concrete. Aldo saw the swordsman now, short, scruffy black hair topped his long and narrow face, and the distant light made the attacker's eyes invisible as it reflected off his glasses.
<br><br>
Once more the swordsman charged him, madly slashing the air as Ando dodged backwards, just barely out of reach of the blade's tip. Finally, the swordsman stopped his assault, and laughed maniacally as Ando placed his back against the wall. Ando tried to catch his breath. The swordsman merely watched the pilot, and after deciding that something about Shoji's posture was hilarious, he renewed his cackling and licked his sword.
<br><br>
"Y-" was all that came out of Ando's mouth, because as he was about to curse at the crazy man, the metal behind him exploded and sheared itself apart, and a man nearly eight feet tall burst from the wall and placed the Zeon hero's head in his darkly-skinned hands and squeezed.
<br><br>
Sho struggled unsuccessfully, before remembering an old trick. His leg swung up and into the hunched giant's face, making an opening for the smaller man to get away. Now that he was free from the musclebound monster, he looked around for an opening to get away, or to attack, or to do both... But instead, he saw the glint of metal once more, this time in the hand of a dwarf. 
<br><br>
A tiny man with a ducktail haircut had joined the fray, and in both of his hands were many, many, many knives. He threw a handful of daggers at Ando, his timing throwing the battered soldier off, and a dagger buried itself in Ando's shoulder, even as the other knives missed completely. Fortunately, he was a Courageous Zaku Fighter, and the dagger wouldn't leave any lasting wounds. None whatsoever.
<br><br>
Sick and tired of knives buzzing around like mosquitoes, Sho threw a furious flying kick at the midget, but the jacked giant deflected the attack with his powerful pecs. "Crazy swordguy," as Sho had mentally dubbed him, saw an opening and renewed his steel whirlwind assault, but this time Sho was prepared, thanks to the midget. He ripped the 6 inch dagger out of his minor wound and met blades with the swordsman, easily challenging the bespectacled warrior. Not easily enough, however, to avoid the knife being flung out of his hand with a sweep of the sword.
<br><br>
The swordsman swung his sword down over Sho's head, but two hands of courage stopped the blade mere inches from their owner's head. Back and forth they tugged on the blade, before Sho decided enough was enough and steeled his resolve.
<br><br>
"Come on, either push or pull. You'd save face if you chopped off at least one finger. Serves you right. Just looking at a wannabe samurai pisses me off!"
<br><br>
And like thunder or lightning, Sho redirected the sword's tip into the giant's head, the giant who had been trying to sneak up on him again, and the tip buried itself between the giant's eyes, decimating gray matter, before being quickly ripped out and used to down the swordsman as well. Now, only the knife-throwing midget, with the greasy ducktail hairdo remained. Sho sneered at the midget as he trembled and raised his arm to throw knives once again. 
<br><br>
Except, this time, Sho had something to throw.
<br><br>
The midget groaned and sobbed as he nursed the bleeding stump where his arm had been, and Sho got to work on wiping the blood from his hands as best he could. Suddenly, he felt eyes watching him from somewhere not too far away; it was the end of the corridor, which had snuck up on him during his battle! He understood who it was even before turning around, and he was ready for the Professor's words. 
<br><br>
"That is why you must pilot the Shin Zaku II! Ando Shoji!" The wizened old man roared from the end of the corridor, and Sho knew it was time.

They knew something is wrong when suddenly, their food got better.  The former bridge crew of the Gwazine class <i>Monarch</i> are then told that they are to face summary execution.  By the order of Admiral Wakkein of the asteroid fortress Luna II, the condemned are to be shot by firing squad.
<br><br>
Except for one man, 2nd Lieutenant Wu Jinyuan.
<br><br>
It was an ensign that told Wu Jinyuan of the Admiral's decision.  In hindsight of the event, the Federal officer recalled the Zeon lieutenant unusually quiet despite the barrage of wit and banter the prison guards had grown used to.
<br><br>
A chaplain made his rounds as he reads the last rights to the condemned.  Some cried or pleaded, but the rest took the news in solemn silence.  As per the law, they are given the right to write wills or statements of last requests.  But finally the fateful hour is upon them.
<br><br>
The silence in the execution room is so intense that the distant humming of Luna II machinery sounded like an active earthquake.  Wu Jinyuan is flanked by two Federal guards as Admiral Wakkein watched from an obersvation room.
<br><br>
Slowly, the bridge crew of the <i>Monarch</i> is marched out.  They are led in front of Jinyuan in a moment that seemed to stretch into eternity.  His eyes went from each person to the next, passing over Siobhan Cuyler and finally looking Capatin Jeanne Schwert in the eyes.  They stared at each other, a muted conversation passing between them.  This is nothing like the fiery arguments that raged between handler and agent, instead it is final contemplation of all that transpired.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Schwert took a step forward up to Jinyuan and saluted.  Surprised, Jinyuan blinked at her.  His hand comes up to return the salute but then the captain of the <i>Erinyes</i> spoke.
<br><br>
"This better be all worth it, Wu," she said," don't forget us and I'll be waiting for you in hell."
<br><br>
Then before anyone can act, Schwert viciously headbutts Jinyuan in the face.  Federal marines dragged her back to the far wall as Jinyuan regains his posture.
<br><br>
He shared one last glare with Schwert as the Zeon bridge crew.  Jinyuan saluted them as blindfolds are placed on them one by one.  There are a few final sobs as the Federal sergeant called for the firing squad to ready.
<br><br>
The Zeon lieutenant was still saluting as the sound of gunfire and empty brass casing died away.  A medic checked the bodies and proclaimed them all dead.
<br><br>
The Federal guards flanking him prodded Jinyuan away from the room and back into the corridor.  There, Admiral Wakkein is waiting.  As the Zeon prisoner is led up to him, the Admiral sneered.
<br><br>
"Their dogtags will be given to you.  Let that be a warning."
<br><br>
The Zeon captive looked at him, a strange mix of defiance and grief on his face.
<br><br>
"Just try me."
