After thirty three thirds of searching, they had finally found him. In the bowels of old Tokyo, ravaged by dozens upon dozens of Gundam Fight, they had found their target. James Radcliffe, Robin Sayer, Des Mielle, Addie Joiner, Tael Thorn, Liliana Frisby, Ritter Novosad, John Cassidy and Kasey Greer all descended on the man. He had black hair, and wore a rather large and bright red matching cloak and bandana.
<br><br>
"Be careful. He might like little girls." Kasey said, hoping he would one day return to the old folks home on his home colony.
<br><br>
"I dub thee SERGEANT BLUE" Addie yelled in response, pointing an accusatory finger at the man. He stopped, turning around with a flash and a lens flare, pushing a picture in all of their faces.
<br><br>
"Have you seen this man?!" He asked.
<br><br>
"No." Responded everybody.
<br><br>
"... Then lets fight!" Answered the mystery man. He dashed forward, kicking Radcliffe into a building. James mumbled something about battle writing being unfair before he died, Robin Sayer and Addie Joiner springing in to avenge their comrade. Addie moved to smack the man with her pistol, but he dropped to the ground, sweep kicking them both before leaping back into the air, slamming each of them against buildings before they hit the ground.
<br><br>
"Oh crap." Said the rest of them, making a run for it while the man, screaming like Bruce Lee, chased after them. Two punches felled Kasey and Tael, and then he simply stood still and posed. A beutiful blue flying sportscar flew around the corner, flattening Mielle, Novosad, Cassidy and Frisby as it went. The man leapt on top of the car and snapped his fingers.
<br><br>
"GANDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM!" he yelled, and was instantly squashed by a giant metallic foot.
<br><br>
"You hear something?" Jack Verse asked, walking his GMPGT through the ruins of old Tokyo.
<br><br>
"Nope. This place is creepy." Responded Arden Massenfer. There were 31 of them, all in their mobile suits, making their way through the city. Somebody had heard something about zombies on the radio, and they had to check it out obviously. Otherwise it wouldn't make for a very cool Halloween FFA. However, it had been some time now, and they hadn't found anything.
<br><br>
"C'mon guys, there's nothing here." Rachel Arronax said, her GM Juggler taking the lead, because only she had the balls to do so.
<br><br>
"I dunno, it's eerily quiet. Hirsch, don't follow so close, eww." Alain Grace said angrily, speeding up to Rachel.
<br><br>
"But but but but" Hirsch responded, sad and dejected.
<br><br>
"I've told you over and over, I was gay LAST RPG, I'm straight now." Alain said angrily, the Efreet putting its hands on its hips. "Go fuck somebody elses mobile suit in the ass." Hirsch sighed, and ran over to Emil Mybergs GM E.
<br><br>
"PEDORAPE!" Emil yelled, but no one heard him over the sound of Caramelldansen blasting in his cockpit.
<br><br>
"You're right guys, it is too quiet." Rachel said. The GM Juggler proceeded to grab two beam sabers, turning them on like the raver glowsticks she loved. "Lets have... A dance off!"
<br><br>
Everyone was intrigued because Rachel was super hot and kind of a slut, so they all ran their mobile weapons around her in a semicircle. Rachel bowed, then picked up the glowsabers and started to perform.
<br><br>
"Ah ah ah ah! Ah ah ah ah! Grooooovin' magic~" she started, and that was all it took to make them appear. Suddenly Death Army units were all around them, the first group descending on Rachel and eating her and her GM alive.
<br><br>
"Zombies! Believe it!" Rhett Paruta yelled, astonished.
<br><br>
"Read the script dumbass, this is G Gundam!" responded Florian Cuyler. The two were cut down by Death Army Zombies before the rest of them got their wits about them, opening fire.
<br><br>
The death army suits fell back, the remainder of the group squeezing into a tight circle, firing all around. Machineguns and beam rifles ran hot as the zombies piled higher, death army units destroyed only to rise up again. Three long white towels shot out of the sky, grabbing Marc Simmons, Jay Tessa and Thorvald Siggurdson and pulling them back to the abyss.
<br><br>
"Why is this happening to me?!? I don't smoke! I'm a conservative Lutheran!" Siggurdson yelled, but it was too late. A Death Birdie dropped out of the sky and picked up Emil, the Swede being taken off to an early grave.
<br><br>
"Noooo my love!" Hirsch howled, killing himself in sadness. While the carnage was going on, Alain Grace and Laredo Veil didn't really know what to do. They had no guns.
<br><br>
"I shall defeat all the zombies with... MY CAMERA!" Laredo said, beginning to take pictures. Grace was annoyed so he picked him up and threw him into the zombies.
<br><br>
"Man, I wish I had some herb right about now." He sighed, Persephone Dawn walking up to him.
<br><br>
"I thought I saw a crack dealer down the street." she said in a monotone. Instantly Alain went berserk, grasping both his heat swords and rushing into the death army. Persephone followed for no particular reason, the two hacking and slashing their way through dozens of monstrous creatures. Flipping, spinning, kicking, punching and stabbing, hundreds of them died before suddenly Alains mobile suit went quiet.
<br><br>
"Oh no, has it been five minutes?!" Grace yelled, death army units eating him up.
<br><br>
"AT field full power!" Persephone responded, but since she isn't actually Rei Ayanami she was eaten too.
<br><br>
The group kept moving, firing as they went, mysteriously grabbing ammunition out of every hole in the wall you could possibly think of, just like on TV. Richard Banks, Arden Massenfer and Bigby Wolfe were fighting their way through an alleyway when they saw a lone Death Army unit. It was crying and had a pink bow on its head.
<br><br>
"Haha! I shall shoot it, because I've had the same character name for six years!" said Arden Massenfer. He shot the Death Army, whose eyes turned bright red.
<br><br>
"No, don't shoot Anastasia I mean the witch!" Banks yelled out, but it was too late. This death army came alive immediately, rushing into them and tearing all three to shreds. Jack Verse and Xaviar Brennan were the next two to go, but before she could get any further the witch was cut clean in two by Ando Shoji's tomahawk.
<br><br>
"IF A BITCH EXISTS, IT IS A MANS JOB TO SLAP HER!" Ando yelled, his bright red Zaku pulling a huge axe out of its shoulder. "NOW I SHALL CARVE MY WAY THROUGH THE ENEMY. WATCH AS THE HERO OF ZAKU FULFILLS HIS DESTINY!" Shoji charged off into the waves of zombie Death Armies, hacking and slashing as he went.
<br><br>
"Wow." Nadia Adelaide looked on, astonished. "He's about the only guy acting like his actual character." However, no one was listening to her. Snickering, an evil glint appeared in Nadias eyes, and she snuck off through a conveniently placed underground tunnel. In the next moment the Grand Gundam smashed through the lines, flinging the survivors every which way.
<br><br>
"TANK!" Cray Vermillion yelled, and before anybody could get the pun his Type 61 fired its super napalm missile at the Grand. It caught fire and ran off, the rest of them trying to reform their line. However, it was too late. Death Masters appeared on the rooftops, swining their towels and ensnaring Issa Kobayashi and Jane Sheppard, pulling them to their deaths. In the confusion someone stepped on Vermillion, his tank exploding and killing him before order could be restored.
<br><br>
"Everyone! Listen to me! I'm an officer!" Jarvis Ackart yelled. However, shortly after, Ackert was shot in the head. "Don't listen to Ackart! Ackert is gay. Listen to me, I am not Ackart, and also a webmaster!" Noelle Everett persisted. However, she too was shot in the head.
<br><br>
"Arrrrrrr, listen to me fer' I'm a pirate!" Samuel Riley responded. The survivors all huddled around him, firing their weapons into the waves of death armies.
<br><br>
"Yo ho! Lets scare them away with bad song!" Riley commanded, waving his shotgun in the air. The group broke out into song, and the Death Army instantly retreated.
<br><br>
<i><center>"We've got us a map!"
<br><br>
"A map!"
<br><br>
"To lead us to a hidden box that's all locked up with locks!"
<br><br>
"With locks!"
<br><br>
"And buried deep away!"
<br><br>
"We'll dig up the box!"
<br><br>
"The box!"
<br><br>
"We know it's filled with precious booty!"
<br><br>
"Bust open the box! And then we'll say hooray!"</center></i>
<br><br>
Suddenly zombie Rachel Arronax appeared, and started singing and dancing.
<br><br>
"Yar har fiddledy dee!" she said, dancing in a pink wig. "If you love to sail the sea, you are a pirate!" Everyone screamed and shot her till she was, in fact, dead.
<br><br>
Despite the inherrant gay of Riley's plan, it seemed that the death army was gone, for now...
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Far away, in another part of Tokyo, a magical airborne Salamis and Medea were floating through the air.
<br><br>
"We've almost found them sir, but there's no sight of DJ or the Death Army." Nigel's crew said, waiting for his commands. Unlike most events, Nigel was today not a coward at all, eager to race towards his own death.
<br><br>
"Bring open a channel with captain Jinyuan." Nigel said. In a moment, Dr. House appeared on the screen.
<br><br>
"Sorry Prince of Hash, I'm a little <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5e6eG6bXAQ&feature=fvw" target=new><u>busy</u></a> right now." answered Dr. House.
<br><br>
"Well, we'll just have to find DJ on our own." Nigel answered. In the Salamis, Issac pointed out the side window, an evil cigar shaped silhouette in the distance.
<br><br>
"There, I see DJ!" He said. His crew was confused. "What's DJ?"
<br><br>
It loomed on like a hellish nightmare of wires, rippling through the core of the submarine as it floated in the air. Two huge brown wings extended from its flanks, causing the monstrosity to look like some sort of estranged Satan, an angel fallen from grace. Where the Jukons bridge should have been the Devil Gundam stood, its two faced torso popping out of the submarine like a cancer. On the Gundams shoulder, standing next to the open cockpit, stood Nadia Adelaide.
<br><br>
"BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! BEHOLD THE PINNACLE OF ZEONIC COMPANIES TECHNOLOGY! THE JUKON V DEVIL GUNDAM TYPE!" She cackled. In the cockpit, a zombified Laurent Auclair drooled silently, dreams of H-manga floating through his mind. In the next instant Devil grabbed Nadia and crushed her.
<br><br>
"I don't need you anymore..." Laurent cackled.
<br><br>
"Oh no! Launch mobile suits!" Nigel yelled. Yuji Takeshi's Apsalus, Chris Burnetts Braw Bro and Jim Irwins Tin Cod sailed out of the Medea, but were quickly shot down by a hail of mega particle fire, Nigels Medea exploding.
<br><br>
"Launch missiles!" Issac responded, his Salamis quickly being cut down as well. As the ship was exploding, the 2nd Persephone Dawn clone jumped off its bridge, her now blue Zaku II Manipulator type holding a huge red lance.
<br><br>
"..." Persephone said, flinging the Lance of Longinus into the Devil Jukon. It pierced the beast from head to toe, forcing it to land on her, killing her again but becoming grounded. The lance flew on and on, also impaling Ando Shoji who was now busy attacking the moons of Jupiter with a heat hawk.
<br><br>
"Blast! I shall now be weakened for dramatic effect!" Laurent howled, the Devil Jukon screaming like robots scream. The six remaining mobile suit pilots looked onwards, Samuel raising his shotgun again.
<br><br>
"We must attack it before the Death Army comes back!" he cried. The six pilots charged, tentacle heads popping up all around the Devil Jukon as they flew through the air. Epic battle music from Last Exile began to play, the group boosting through a jungle of Devil heads as they flew for the body and heart of the offending Gundam. Markos Steiner was cut down first, unable to make it through the forest of enemies. Caleb DeGrau slashed his way through several tentacles, flying upwards and blasting his beam rifle into the Devil Gundams torso. However, he was unable to hurt Laurent, the Devil Gundam taking him down with vulcans and the ProtoGelgoog landing in a sea of tentacles.
<br><br>
"There are too many!" Jack Murphy said, a tentacle head grabbing his mobile suit and swallowing it whole. Only Samuel Riley and Aurem Senaiha were left.
<br><br>
"Aurem! I must call upon the power of the Cid! Cover me!" Samuel yelled, landing on the body of the Jukon V. Aurems GM Sniper landed next to him, and plugging the LRBR into the Jukon, he pulled the weapons trigger. A neverending beam of mega particles shot from the now DG cell infected Long Range Beam Rifle, cutting off the heads of thousands of devil tentacles. Samuel finished his prayer just as the LRBR overheated, exploding and killing Aurem. Two tentacles appeared on either side of Samuels Zaku II C, lunging for him when a pair of shining gold Zaku II HMTs shot out of the sky, felling the tentacles with heat swords. Suddenly Samuels Zaku turned bright gold, the signs of Texas Colony, Amador City and the Blackrock Pirates glowing on the three Zakus palms.
<br><br>
"All this has happened before!" Yelled Fria Engel, looking at the other two.
<br><br>
"And all this will happen again!" Answered Jonas Keller. Samuel Riley stood between them, the three forming giant balls of ki in their palm.
<br><br>
"CID DOUMEI KEN!" Samuel yelled, the three firing their beams towards Laurent in unison. An image of Releena Peacecraft with crossed arms shone in front of the ball, which smashed through the Devil Gundam, destroying it and Laurent utterly.
<br><br>
The three Zakus lost their golden shine afterwords, and were busy being angry or something when they were destroyed by mega particle fire.
<br><br>
"Aw damn, I'm late for the FFA. At least I won." Dr. House said, the Erinyes floating above old Tokyo.
