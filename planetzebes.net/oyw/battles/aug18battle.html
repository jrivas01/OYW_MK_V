<br>
Dagobert Lavache settled back into the plush seat of his GM Sniper II. The surroundings out her in space were a bit drab, compared to what he was used to, but he made do. His cockpit was nice and neat, and comfortable - comfortable enough, at least. He wiggled his privileged buns into the seat, as he took another quick peek through his targeting computer. [i]There![/i]
<br><br>
The tiny dot in the distance grew to a lone GM Command as he zoomed in, simultaneously hefting the large sniper rifle to his shoulder. He had 5 sabot rounds loaded - five chances to take his enemy out of the picture forever, and if if intel on his target was correct, this opponent deserved it. She was one of Zeon's most decorated pilots, and had recently escaped Jaburo.
<br><br>
"It's nothing personal, you understand," he murmered, as the targeting computer locked onto the unsuspecting GM. "I am normally quite polite in the presence of ladies."

<br>
Haifa Hahnemeule was enjoying space. There was just so much, well, [i]space[/i]. It was a nice contrast with her recent stay as a captive at Jaburo, and though the cockpit was slightly more cramped than her cell, she was in control this time, and it didn't feel small. She brethed the recycled air deeply, the [i]free[/i] air. She'd been stopped and captured in Jaburo and frustrated in an attempt to get into space; nothing could stop her now!
<br><br>
She enjoyed it, right up until she felt the high-veolicty round impact her GM's left leg, sending her hurtling through space.
<br><br>
"Ohcrapohcrapohcrapohcrap!" She cursed, trying to steady the suit. The next shot made it more difficult, and after the third, she was more concerned with getting the hell out of there than mounting a counterattack. Mercifully, an asteroid was drifting by, and Haifa managed to send the suit behind it, hiding from where she estimated the shots had come from.
<br><br>
She waited for what seemed like hours, beam sabers drawn, for her attacker to pursue her, but Dagobert had left hours ago. He was polite and he was efficient - he was a sniper; melee combat was not his thing, and neither was chasing down damaged aces. He'd done his job; now, the rest of the EFSF could do theirs.

For nearly two centuries, Jaburo has endured. 

<br><br>

It was silent witness to the unification brought about by the Earth Federation's peacekeepers and the seeds of rebellion sown by their bureaucrat's decadence. It stood fast as one in four was cannibalized in an orgy of violence and a continent was devoured by a blow that forever altered the globe. When mechanical soldiers fell from the heavens, the old bastion did not sit idle.

<br><br>

In its inner caverns, hope grew ripe. When the invaders made their push, Jaburo met them with champions who pushed back the tide again and again. Now the Earth Federation stood on the brink of their greatest battle yet. Their grand fleet was nearing the first of Zeon's own bastions while others were sweeping the planet clean.

<br><br>

Today though something new was making its way to the surface.

<br><br>

A strange mobile suit slowly made its way from one of Jaburo's lifts. It was a chimera of mobile suit and plane technology, and a pretty ugly chimera at that. What it lacked in beauty though it made up for in potential. One of its hands held a beam rifle. On each shoulder a mega-particle cannon sat ready for use and there were missiles waiting inside its core. The firepower on this unit was ludicrous; a shocking glimpse what the future would bring.

<br><br>

"Jim Irwin, taking off in 3, 2, 1..."

<br><br>

On cue the Gundam's thrusters flared. It took a step forward and then another and another as it built up speed. The suit sprinted through the burnt growth and past the husks of fallen cyclops. When Irwin was satisfied with the speed, the mobile weapon leapt and then... 

<br><br>

Jaburo had endured for nearly two centuries. It had witnessed a great many things but it had never before seen its iconic Gundam weapons soar through the skies. Judging by the fallen cyclops littering its surface, it seemed like quite the safe bet to say the GT-FOUR would be far from the last.
