<br>
“Hello everybody and welcome to today's paintball shooting range event! I am your host Marty. Today we have a special treat for you all its the entire ZEF. Yes that's right all 10 ZEF members are split up into two teams. The team to get the highest score wind and the losers well we have something planed for them as a consolation prize.”
<br><br>
The lights shut off then strobe back on as the contestants come forward. 
<br><br>
“Leading team one is Caleb DeGrav, piloting the Gelgoog cannon. Who is accompanied by Emil, Olivia, and Richard in their Rick Dom II's along with Anya in the Zaku II R1 HMT!.” 
<br><br>
The announcer then looks to his right of team one and continues. 
<br><br>
“Over here we have Team two which is led by none other than Veronica Wu, captain of the Chivvay class battleship. Along with Veronica we have newtype Florian in the Schnee Weiss, Felix in the Val Varo Mobile Armor, Yoritomo in the action Zaku and Junichi in the Zaku Kai!” 
<br><br>
The participants all take their positions on the line awaiting for the contest to start. The announcer starts talking a bit about the rules again. 
<br><br>
“In the contest the participants are notified in their own mobile suits and ships prior to starting. That makes them think on their feet. Now let the contest begin!”
<br><br>

<br>
All the pilots revived their targets for the contest to begin. All the audience already knows who gets shot down by which pilot and suit. The count down starts. The pilots all prepare for their first shots. This contest is a test of reflexes and timing and luck. Epically for the Rick Dom II's. The countdown hits five, the pilots grip their controls harder as they await the final seconds before the frenzy starts.  As the count down reaches zero and the alarm sounds, Emil aims the Rick Dom II's bazooka at the Newtype MS but then Emil realizes that everybody else, even his own team members are aiming their guns at Emil's mobile suit.
<br><br>
Emil sighs as the Rick Dom II is pelted by pink Paint balls. The Val Varo adds insult by slapping the rear end of Emil's Rick Dom II leaving an imprint of its claw. Then Veronica fires the cannons on the Chivvay at Emil's Rick Dom II covering it in a hot pink color. Just then the Chivvay fires marines out of its missile tubes and they paint “Wu PWNED” on the chest of the humiliated Rick Dom II.
