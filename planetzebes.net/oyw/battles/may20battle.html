It took a few hours but the navigational beacons that populated the traffic lanes of the Earth Sphere gradually disappeared.  The Pirates of Black Rock breath a sigh of relief as they return to Deep Space.  This was their home.  This is the void that they grew up with.  This is their home territory.
<br><br>
They left the Earth Sphere richer and full of bounty than when they arrived.  The Pirates boasts three full fleets.  A mixed collection of civilian and the latest in Duchy of Zeon military technology.  Now the Pirates will turn that military might on to their next victim.
<br><br>
There is still time before that day arrives.  Time that the "The Wraith" plans to spend being productive.
<br><br>

<br>
"Right, so here it is."
<br><br>
Jacobin Conroy stepped into the storage room.  He can hear the footsteps of his squad of Martian Freemen following him.  They are silent except for the mechanical wheezing of their face masks.
<br><br>
The crewman who is responsible for inventory pointed at a series equipment bundles on a rack.  "Those are it."
<br><br>
Conroy walked over, his immense size drwafing the crewman, and picked one of the bundles up.
<br><br>
"It's a satchel charge based around a paintball used by mobile suits," explained the crewman nervously," all you have to do is set the timer and heave it.  Same thing you would do with a bundle of explosives."
<br><br>
"And the captain?"
<br><br>
"He'll be trying to target each one of you with a laser sight.  Your zero-g suits have reflectors on them.  A beacon will go off when the light from the laser hits the beacon long enough.  Just... don't look at the laser itself."
<br><br>
By this point in time, the rest of the Martian Freemen are in the storage room.  They each picked up the packages to test the weight.  After a short moment they looked at each other.  Turning to Conroy, they nodded their approval.
<br><br>
Conroy nodded back then started collecting equipment.
<br><br>
"Sir?  Are you sure this is wise?"  asked the crewmen as the fighters ignored him for the moment.  "Going up again a mobile suit with only this is unfair."
<br><br>
Conroy stopped what he was doing and looked the young man straight in the eye.
<br><br>
"So?"  And that was the end of that.
<br><br>

It was like hunting mice for Samue Riley.  His Rick Dom II flew around the exterior of one of his ships.  The monoeye swivel back and forth looking for his game.  Suddenly, movement.
<br><br>
A Martian Freeman rocketed forward and heaved his bundle.
<br><br>
"Ah-har!" chuckled Riley.  His MMP-80 machinegun came up with its laser emitter on full power.
<br><br>
The ambusher was bout to disappear around a corner on the ship's hull when a loud electronic wail cried out.  He spat in discuss as his beacon continued transmitting that he is "dead".
<br><br>
Riley flipped the Rick Dom II around and continued his hunt.  Once again, he spots movement.  With a giant flare of engines, the mobile suit sped up faster than a lone person with a flightpack.  The Wrath raised his machinegun as the laser emitter blanketed the whole area.
<br><br>
But no transmitter went off.
<br><br>
The pirate captain zoomed in on his cameras.  Yes, there is a flight suit-
<br><br>
-But it is empty.  One of its sleeves is held to the hull by a giant knife.
<br><br>
From the shadows of the crevices around Riley's Rick Dom II, Conroy and the rest of the Martian Freemen pounced.  The former miner had taken a spare flight suit.  He had gambled that Riley would fall for the bait.
<br><br>
Now, a handful of men swung their paint explosive devices at Riley's camera.  The Wraith knew he is caught in a trap; he would expect no less from his men.  But Riley did not earn his reputation by calling it quits while in a tight spot.
<br><br>
A brillant flash washed over Conroy and his men.  The light was so blinding that it felt as they were hit by a physical force.  The intensity was strong enough to set all of their transmitters wailing until they burnt out.
<br><br>
Riley slumped in his seat as he congratulated himself.  As a precaution, he had kept the scattering beam gun charged on its lowest setting.  The blindling light is his ace up his sleeve just in case Conroy ambushed him like this.
<br><br>
With that over, Riley proceeded to collect Conroy and his men.  He will need them soon.
