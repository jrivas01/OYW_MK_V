<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>Buster Got Busted!</b></font></center>
<br>
The Buster Ni Go approaches a Zeon mining facility. The Salamis Kai class, commanded by Captain Alfred Gardner, attacked Overlord 9 just a few days ago, and now it was Overlord 4's turn. The plan wasn't a great one, and there was little chance of success with the damages the ship endured through the last mine atack, so morale wasn't the highest. All personnel were in spacesuits for precautionary measures. As Buster reached ever close to the base, Saberfish scrambled to intercept any defenses.
<br><br>
As the Saberfish were spotted during their launch, Overlord 4 counterattacked with a squad of four Zaku IIs.The Saberfish fired their nose turrets and several anti-ms missiles to disable their mechanical foes. The Zaku IIs evaded and held their ground, or space, I should say. The units retalliated with their Zaku machineguns, unleashing rounds of bullets into the invaders. The Zaku IIs began to overwhelm the Saberfish units, but the Buster Ni Go wasn't just going to sit by.
<br><br>
"Provide support fire for the Saberfish!" commanded Alfred as he watched the battle escalate.
<br><br>
The Buster Ni Go aided the Saberfish with just enough fire power to keep the Zakus off them. As the battle continued, the Zakus drew the Federation forces ever closer to the mine. Finally, the mine was in range, and main guns powered up.
<br><br>
"Target the base with all primary and secondary guns!" ordered Alfred in a sudden outburst
<br><br> 
With the ships damages, only a handful of guns were operating, and they were operating at a reduced power output.Regardless the base was rocked by the Buster Ni Go's cannon fire. Before the base could be assauted a second time, a sudden asteroid rocket cluster was launched at the Salamis Kai class.
<br><br>
With limited thruster capabilities and a lack of time, the Buster Ni Go was officially put out of commision. The asteroid rocket cluster would be the coup de grace that would put the wounded ship out of its misery.
<br><br>
"Abandon ship! I'll hold them off as long as I can." ordered Alfred.
<br><br>
"I can't let you do that!" shouted Gin as a tear dripped down her cheek.
<br><br>
"It is the only way! Now go!" shouted Alfred
<br><br>
"Never!" replied Gin
<br><br>
"You leave me no choice. Security officer Chan, escort Miss Vida of the ship in escape capsule along with the rest of the crew." ordered Alfred
<br><br>
As Chan grappled onto the ginger haired communications officer, Alfred leaned forward to kiss her one last time. The crew managed to make it to the capsule, while the Saberfish held off the Zaku IIs. They weren't doing too hot as they lost their support from the Buster Ni Go. Anti-Aircraft cannons began opening fire on both the saberfish and the Salamis Kai.
<br><br>
"A Captain always goes down with his ship." Alfred said as he set the Salamis on a collision course with Overlord 4.
<br><br>
Saberfish were being dispersed as they struggled with the Zakus.A Saberfish managed to take out a Zaku with a missile, but not before losing two allies to machiengun fire. Shortly afterwards the unit was cleaved in half by a heat hawk. Two saberfish managed to fill a Zaku II's chest full of turret rounds, by cornering it, but they were soon shot down by drawing in too close to the anti-aircraft turrets. One of the two managed to kamikaze their saberfish into the turret. Alfred rams the Buster Ni Go into the last Zaku II. The ship is shot down before hitting its intended target, but the blast takes out the Zaku II regardless.

<br><br><br>

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>Tornado of Pain</b></font></center>
<br>
Tuscany, central Italy.  Legions of the great Roman Empire once marched through.  So did the mechanized armies of the Allies and Axis powers during World War II.  Now a new era of war will devastate the country where some of the most influential figures in history call home: Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Gallileo Galilei.
<br><br>
The birthplace of the Italian Renaissance shutters in the morning wind.  Suddenly hot air tore leaves off trees as a wild air-to-air missile explodes right above the tree tops.  But before the ravaged trees could even settle back, all of the vegetation on the lush countryside disappeared in the blazing inferno of high explosives.
<br><br>
In the middle of it, the Dobday-class land battleships of the Zeon fleet "G-Force" crashed through the hell that is spilling over Tuscany.  Their twin barrel main cannon turrets thunders while the smaller heavy machine gun turrets poured steel into the air.
<br><br>
Towards the coast of Tuscany where Italy meets the Mediterrenean Sea, the Big Tray <i>Big Sioux</i> let loose a broadside from its triple barrel turrets.  Out to sea, the Himalaya-class <i>Lleu Llaw Gyffes</i> shuttered as her deck launched another wave of aircraft.  Federal planes empty on fuel and ammunition jerked as their hooks caught on arrestor cables on the flight deck.  Hovering over the ship are the two Medeas of the "87th Integrated Fleet".  The <i>Spirit of New Amsterdam</i> and <i>Missouri</i> had long emptied their cargo holds of the mobile suits they carried into battle.  Essentially useless for the remainder of the battle, they stay close to the Himalaya's protective air cover.
<br><br>
Shells fill the air under the massive duel between the Federal Tin Cods and Zeon Dopps.  While much more numerous, the Tin Cods do not match up spec for spec with the Dopp.  The air battle grows tense as Lieutenant Jim Irwin's damaged Tin Cod lead another squadron of Federal fighters into the meat grinder.  The veteran pilot grunted as his struggling plane is baffled by being so close to so many jet engines.
<br><br>
"Damnit!" he grunted as he saw another wave of shells land around the advancing Big Tray.  Over his cockpit canopy, a Dopp chased a Tin Cod.  But that's not what worried him.  Ahead of the Big Tray is a line of Federal Mobile Suits pinned in the Italian soil.  
<br><br>
"We need to break through their air defenses!" he told his fellow Tin Cod pilots," if we don't distract those Dobdays, our mobile suits are going to be pounded to pieces!"
<br><br>
Down below him, the Federal mobile suits couldn't agree more.  Sergeant Jay Tessa can actually feel the world shake her mobile suit by the rain of artillery fire.  Her small frame is barely secured by the seat harness.  The GMPGT's 100mm machinegun roars as it sought out the Zeon targets just out of her reach.
<br><br>
Further down the Federal line, Corporal Kyle Slater dropped teh GMPGT to one knee as he took aim with his beam rifle.  His GM teammate crouched behind its tower shield while acting as a lookout.  The dedicated EF pilot open fire on a suspicious target.
<br><br>
To his disappointment, the beam went off its mark and burned away a large chunk of Tuscany's rich soil instead.  Behind Slater, two shapes are huddled on top of the <i>Big Sioux</i>.  Private Aurem Senaiha and Private Arieta Marius were find targets in the Zeon forces.  Despite the GM Ground Sniper's Long Range Beam Rifle, the hilly Italian countryside shortens the range his range his beam can reach.  It would have been easier with artillery but since Senaiha doesn't have that luxury, he and Arieta must be patient as they wait for their prey.
<br><br>
A GM Command stood up in the swirling mess of fulling munitions.  Lieutenant Jarvis Ackart, in all the expected glory of being the son of a British politician, waved his Beam gun towards the Zeon line.  "C'mon you blokes!  Get yer arse into gear and move it!"
<br><br>
It was easier said than done.  The wheel-chair bonded Corporal Jack Murphy clutched the controls of his shaking Guntank MPT.  Still suffering from damage, the artillery unit is surrounded by other Guntank MPTs.  But even their combined firepower is being outclassed by the more modern Xamel units on the other side of the artillery duel.
<br><br>
That's not saying the 120mm rounds aren't doing damage.  But the offensive punch the Federal mobile suit teams need to close the distance to the G-Force fleet had been blunted by Zeon artillery.  
<br><br>
Even worse, damaged units such as Corporal Bigby Wolfe's damaged GM Desert Type can barely apporach the front thanks to the rain of Zeon shells.  The EFGF's ace juggernaut the Blue Destiny is still showering the injuries it recieved from its fight against the Efreet Custom.  Private Thorvald Siggurdson gently urges Marion on as they look for an opening in the fierce fighting.
<br><br>
But there is one Federal pilot, who is alone and closer to the Zeon lines than anyone else.  Private Arianna Elvy Saoirse slides her GM S Type side to side.  Her Tin Cods left her a while ago, having being engaged by Zeon Dopp fighters.  While her immediate attention if focused on the flashes of light in front of her, memories of the scene at <i>The Hovel</i> came back to her.  She hasn't quite figured out how to deal with Bryce Hollerfelt.  All she could recall is that she needs to be careful around tanks...
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Things aren't going so well for the Zeon fleet "G-Force" either.  While buoyed by their successful elimination of the Federal base of Malta, they need to fight their way up Italy's heel in order to escape the Federation's revenge.  In order to do so, they need to hold off the Himalaya's air power while forcing aside the Federal Big Tray so they can pass.
<br><br>
To this effect, the warmonger known as Master Sergeant Aleck Irusk relish this feeling.  The feeling that each time his 680mm fires, someone's day is ruined on the other end makes the former artillery instructor feel good inside.  Nested among other Xamels and Zeon artillery mobile suits, it was as if a constant hail of high explosives is going down on the enemy position.  To enhance this effect, a Jukon beyond the range of the <i>Lleu Llaw Gyffes</i>'s sensors unloaded a whole missile barrage on the Federal position.
<br><br>
Watching the missile contrails was a beautiful sight indeed.
<br><br>
But the pressure of the Federal forces didn't falter.  Even now, the small colorful face optics of Federal mobile suits are getting closer and closer to the Zeon artillery line.
<br><br>
Private David Anderson's enormous Adzam is reduced to being an overgrown gun platform.  His Gouf Flight Type zips by overhead, doing its best to keep Tin Cods away from the big target known as the Adzam.  It was a game of whack-a-mole for Anderson as he tries to hit the Federal MS through the hilly Italian countryside.
<br><br>
Even the normally cheerful Staff Sergeant Duncan Keystone is deeply focused on this battle.  He and the rest of his MS Team are a little forward of his Xamel.  Keystone's Gouf stays close to the Gouf Heavyarms.  He did not want to let a product of the superior Gouf mobile suit line stray far from his sight.
<br><br>
If there was anyone on the battlefield who was not having such a hard time with the terrain, it would be Sergeant Ferusha Glavadeen and her Zaku II F.  Together with her MS Team, the lavender hair-colored pilot found herself amazingly capable of timing her bazooka shots to intercept a Federal unit as it emerged from behind cover.
<br><br>
But not all was so lucky.  Lieutenant Marko Dresner fired off a 290mm rocket at what he thought was an emerging GM.  A plume of dirt was his reward as the Dowadge swooped around.  They are lingering here too long and they aren't cutting down as much of the Federal force as they should be.  The only good thing so far is that Zeon artillery is making a good mess of the Federal forces.  Victory hung on the edge of a knife and the G-Force still has plenty of weight left to push it in their favor.
<br><br>
But there are so things out of the control of commanders.  Irusk winces as he felt the familiar recoil of the breech rock his Xamel when he noticed something wrong.  There is a hole in the artillery line!  One of the heavy support units is missing.
<br><br>
Irusk suddenly spotted deep tank threads in the Italian dirt.  To his utter amazement, the Hildofr is leaving the rank and file of the Zeon line.  Inside the giant tank, Private Bryce Hollerfelt's mind is filled with purpose.  He has his promise to Arianna and he will fulfill it.
<br><br>
Suddenly an enemy ahead of him, separated from the rest!  But is it the enemy...?
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
On board the Himalaya-class <i>Lleu Llau Gyffes</i>, the radio operator hands a message to his supervisor.  The message note is soon placed in the captain's hands.
<br><br>
"Reinforcements?" asked the captain.
<br><br>
"Yes sir, apparently it's a late supply Medea with mobile suits."
<br><br>
"Odd, I don't recall sending any requests."
<br><br>
"Neither does the Quartermaster sir, but the authentication codes check out."
<br><br>
"Very well," concluded the captain," have the Tin Cods prepare an approach vector for the Medea."
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
David Mass hid a sigh of relief as the Medea-class <i>Vulture</i> recieved approval from the Federal fleet.  The Medea dipped its wings and began to inconspicously fly in on a proper approach vector.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the former Colony Republican Guard opened the door to the cargo hold.  There lay three older Zaku II Cs.  He watched as the three Australian University students climbed into their mobile weapons.  First Jackie, then Marie, and then Elizabeth disappeared into the Zeon machines.  This contract will be their first sortie and Mass hopes they all come back from it.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Federal mobile suits charged over yet another hill in Tuscany.  A few of them are struck by bullets and rockets but most of them cleared the leap.  Overhead, the ability of the Himalaya to recover and relaunch fighters is showing a decisive edge as less and less Dopps return to challenge the Federal aircraft.
<br><br>
Unknowingly, the leaders of both the Federal forces and Zeon forces decided to use their thrump cards.
<br><br>
Both came soaring in from high altitude.  The Medeas of the 42nd Brigade under Lieutenant Nigel Ferdinand's command came barraging in on G-Force from an unexpected angle away from the air battle.  The escorting fighters took a heavy toll but soon, infantry are parachuting from the Medeas.
<br><br>
But to no avail.  The slowly descending soldiers are soon met by redirected AA.  A Luggun coordinated their rapid elimination only to then refocus the Dobday's attention of the fleeing Medeas.
<br><br>
Despite the loss in human life, the desired effect is achieved.  For nearly two minutes, the Zeon artillery slacken.  With a great roar of gears and servos, Federal mobile suits rose up and closed the distance with the Zeon mobile suits.
<br><br>
Then the Federal fleet recieved its only rude shock.  From the high clouds, rode Master Sergeant Rhett Paruta with the Zanzibar-class <i>Shooting Star</i>.  Captain Vina Sealander and her mega particle cannons began ripping their way through the Federal defenders standing in her way.  Unlike the Medeas of the 42nd Brigade, the <i>Shooting Star</i> had real combat pilot.
<br><br>
Still, even a blazing comet like the <i>Shooting Star</i> is stopped short.  A GM Sniper, held in reserve for just this contingency, let loose with a single precise long range beam sniper shot.  The pink beam struck the <i>Shooting Star</i> like a massive fist.  Almost immediately, Paruta went from beind on the attack to defending his wounded ship.
<br><br>
Then came what is to be the decisive move of the battle.  While the Medeas of the 42nd Brigade had no real teeth of their own, they are the eyes to deadly fangs.
<br><br>
Kilometers away, Guntanks attached to another jurisdiction adjusted their 120mm armaments.  More than the usual had been requisitioned for this moment, such was the influence of the Dutch prince, Nigel Ferdinand.
<br><br>
With the Zeon artillery effort disrupted, this new shower of Federal explosives completely tore apart cohesion in the Zeon ranks.  The Samson-class <i>Big Rig</i> exploded out right as the Dobdays moved out of the way.  At this critical point in time, Jim Irwin in his battered Tin Cod exploited a gap in the thinning Dopp lines.
<br><br>
Soon, Federal aircraft of zipping by over the heads of the Federal Mobile Suit force as they viciously clashed with Zeon mobile weapons.
<br><br>
Senaiha finally sighted the Adzam and tore off one of its giant legs with the first shot.  The second ripped off a chunk of the Adzam's side before Anderson successfully withdrew.
<br><br>
The GMPGT pilots Jay Tessa and Kyle Slater found that while their Lunar Titanium armor are suspectible to the expert Zeon artillery, the armor performs much better against Zaku weapons.  Beam weapons discharge among the Zeon ranks.
<br><br>
Glavadeen tossed away her 120mm machinegun in disgust as she parried a beam saber with her heathawk.  Near her, Dresner's Dowadage is finding it hard to keep manuevering in the tightening confines.  Irusk reered his Xamel back as two GMs charge him, only to surprise both of them with close range weapons fire.  The MMP-80 and 360mm Giant Bazooka looking silly in the Xamel's small hands.
<br><br>
The only person who seem to be in his prime is Duncan Keystone and his Gouf.  Whipping his way through his Federal enemies, this moment of intense combat validates his belief that the Gouf is the superior machine.
<br><br>
Something else is brewing on this battlefield however.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Hollerfelt bounced in his seat as he circled the Federal mobile suit.  Wondering if the enemy pilot has spotted him, the Hildofr tried to run around the unit.
<br><br>
But Arianna Elvy Saoirse is better than that.  Her GM S type saw a fast moving shaped and quickly chased it.  Hollerfelt noticed his pursuer and in a spinning about face, transformed into mobile suit mode.
<br><br>
The Gm S type's 100mm machine gun met the Hildofr's 120mm machinegun as both pilots began circling each other.  To their surprise, the other didn't fire.  They are too close for Hollerfelt to try using his main cannon while on the move on such bumpy terrain.  Saoirse thought, by the looks of the enemy's armor, that even her bazooka cannot pierce the plating on a tank like-.
<br><br>
Tank?
<br><br>
"Bryce!" she screamed in revelation as her GM S type pointed its 100mm machinegun away.
<br><br>
Hollerfelt saw the GM lower its weapon and realized himself what is happening.  But then, like all things on the battlefield, luck changed.
<br><br>
While focused on each other, neither the Federation nor the Zeon pilot noticed the rapid approach of the Big Tray-class <i>Big Sioux</i>.  Saoirse stared in horror as a corner of the front of the Big Tray rammed the Hildofr, sending the mobile tank spinning into the air.
<br><br>
To Hollerfelt, it was like he was tossed into a washing machine.
<br><br>
The flying tank is then caught in the missile wave of a strafing Fly Manta.  But before the now flaming tank could touch the ground again, a Guntank MPTrumbled up from behind a hill.  The poor Federal pilot was trying to get his unit in a better firing position when the spiraling Hildofr crashed through its upper section, killing the pilots instantly.  By the time the Zeon mobile tank slide to a stop, none of the Hildofr's tank threads are left and it lay there sprawled on the ground.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"So we are through their lines?"
<br><br>
"Yes captain."  The report is well recieved on the bridge of the <i>Lleu Llau Gyffes</i>.  "We have penetrated their air fleet and our mobile suits are within their artillery lines."
<br><br>
"Good, good, well done- What is that?"
<br><br>
"Huh, that's the Medea from earlier.  I thought it was supposed to land?  Perhaps it had a bad approach and needed to make another pass-"
<br><br>
"It's a vertical take-off plane, you idiot!"
<br><br>
At that moment, the doors of the <i>Vulture</i> swung open and one by one the Australian high school girl piloted Zaku II Cs descended upon the Himalaya carrier.
<br><br>
Not like it mattered much.  Corporal Charles Gano was worried that he was not going to have any major part in this battle.  Regulated to aquatic defense of the carrier with the Don Escargots, it was as though he was deployed against a threat that never existed.
<br><br>
But now the three Zaku II Cs came down like clay pigeons at the country club.  The Don Escargots, Gano's underwater machinegun, and the carrier's AA tore holes into the enemy mobile suits.  One, then two, and finally the third one exploded in mid air.  But the debris still fell, slamming into the flight deck as the Himalaya shook to one side.
<br><br>
Onboard the <i>Vulture</i>, Mass stared in horror at the quick deaths of the 01 MS Team.  The Medea crew had more immediate concerns such as escaping the vengeful AA fire of the 87th Integrated Fleet.  Holes puncture all over the aircraft, even the bridge as flak sliced open Mass's left arm.  But by sheer luck, the Medea flew out to sea.
<br><br>
The attack on the Himalaya did accomplish one thing however.  The sudden lost in coordination briefly recalled or paused the advancing Federal force.  
<br><br>
Survivors of the Zeon defense line are picked up by the comrades.  It took two Doms for example to lift the Hildofr like a giant roast pig before fleeing from the battlefield.  
<br><br>
By the time the momentum of the Federal attack resumed, there was nothing left but the wasted countryside of Tuscany.<br><br>
