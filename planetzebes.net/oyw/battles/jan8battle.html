There are no fingerprints deep underwater. Nothing to tie one to a crime. And if you seek vengeance, all you need are instruments of pain.

Blue like the antediluvian ocean, tall with leading-edge technologies, and armored like a marine knight, the Earth Federation's top secret weapon for the maritime battlefield, the Waterproof Gundam, was tense with preparedness for its singular duty: the domination of the Duchy of Zeon's muscular terrestrial forces. Its weapons, varied and dedicated in purpose, were primed for use, tingling with antipodal energy, ready to sink ships, pierce cockpits, and redecorate coastal bases with ash and the lubricant blood of machines. A machine all Hirsch Muncheck's, not just in use and deployment, but in its very essence a weapon meant for him.
<br><br>
It was standing proudly, a symbol of Federal technological prowess, an extension of centuries spent in the perfection of terrestrial war machines. Hundreds of years spent learning how to better kill Zeek, Charlie, Ivan-- whatever name you gave the man in front of you-- to penetrate their flanks, to gore their yielding, visceral entrails, to blowing them up so well that there's nothing left to send back home. And anything, any Zeon mobile suit, any boat, any base, <i>anything at all</i>, would fall opposing this Mobile Suit if it was in the right hands. And it was.
<br><br>
Indeed, the RAG-79-G1 was tangibly volatile, seeming to possess a devotion to the destruction of Zeon even absent a pilot; likely a result of the life the name "Gundam" had acquired, fueled by equal parts mechanical superiority, outstanding combat records, and the appearance of a armored knight. The blue Gundam was aching to make its mark to become a mighty thrust, swiftly parting Zeon's tired ranks, a thrust propelling the Federation to a victorious climax and beyond.
<br><br>
<i>I bet Gaj'd have an explanation if I asked him how the Gundam ended up mine. At least one that's more interesting than the truth,</i> Hirsch thought to himself, staring up at the machine, now wholly ready for deployment, for actual combat. On each side of it were two more marine Mobile Suits, a familiar Aqua GM and a GM diver. A new name was being painted near one of the machines cockpit, a last-second modification before combat deployment. In addition to the comforting sight of  the intimately familiar weapons was a new addition to the Krakens, equally comforting; due in no small part to its formiddable assortment of weapons, both slung over its shoulders and inside the massive weapons crate accompanying it on deployment.
<br><br>
"It's a good time to be Hirsch Muncheck, and a bad time to be a Zeek, huh partner?" Hirsch pushed his glasses back up his nose and grinned at the Gundam before a forklift moving a massive crate obscured the explosive Leviathan from his sight.

<br>
Vegetation whipped back and forth across the steppes of Central Asia.  Dust and sand swirl in the massive winds that grind away the land.  The howling of the wind is so deafening that it can be heard even through the large radio headsets of the listening post.
<br><br>
The Zeon patrol group "Blue Dragon" would normally be flying on patrol but the winds grounded the Dodai YS aircraft and their mobile suits.  It is too dangerous to loiter in the air but the Zeon units can launch at a moments notice.  That time is upon them as a runner dashed from the listening post tents towards the pilot's shelter.
<br><br>
The flight leader took a single look at the message paper then kicked his wingmen awake.  The Dodai crew are then alerted and not before long, jet engine blasts addeed to the severe winds that swept across Central Asia.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
A small jeep bounced as it crossed the terrain of Central Asia.  Behind it is a Type 74 whose hover craft system offered a better ride.  Looming behind the two vehicles are the three mobile suits belonging to Aisha Vemunio.
<br><br>
The Irish girl is thankful for how well recieved the African Union is to the local population.  This part of the continent is still under Zeon control and getting around unnoticed would be much harder without their contacts.  The small team of rogues were fortunate to find a sympathetic merchant who knew the routes in the region.  They are on one of those trails now, whose purpose probably began as a smuggling route centuries ago.
<br><br>
The monotonous journey is suddenly pierced by a sound louder than the wind howling outside Asiah Vemunio's mobile suit.  Two blue objects flew past her from behind and pounced on her Zaku II Cs.  The Goufs took the mobile suits by surprise as the blue zeon mobile suits leap off their Dodais and stabbed the Zaku II Cs with their heat swords.  Vemunio had barely registered the crisis when something collided with her mobile suit.
<br><br>
The collision struck Vemunio so hard that her breasts hit her in the face as the GM Ground Type crashed to the ground.  Her mobile suit leap to its feet, impact dents decroated the Lunar Titanium armor on its back.  Around her, the three Goufs turn to Vemunio as they discarded the lifeless husks of the Zaku II Cs.
<br><br>
The African Union pilot thumbs the beam saber as she brought her 100mm machinegun to bear. The pinging sound of 75mm shells actually drown out the sound of the howling wind in her cockpit.  They scattered but one got caught by her machinegun and fell to the ground.  Before it could get back up, Vemunio thrusts her beam saber into the Gouf's chest.  The blue mobile suit struggled for another second before becoming lifeless.
<br><br>
Suddenly a heat rod flew around the GM Ground Type's head, snapping the mobile suit back.  Vemunio fought for control as she is dragged towards a second Gouf, heat sword ready.  The tug-of-war went on for another twenty seconds until suddenly, the line with slack.
<br><br>
The GM Ground Type fired its thrusters and jumped at the Gouf restraining her, catching it off guard.  The sudden movement threw the Gouf off balance and Vemunio felt the metallic clang of their two suits colliding.  Quickly, she primed one of her grenades and dropped on the fallen Gouf.
<br><br>
Vemunio barely managed to roll out of the way when the grenade exploded, immolating the Gouf.  The GM Ground Type slid until it finally came to a stop.  The African Union pilot looked around but only saw the dead Zaku II Cs and the two destroyed Goufs.  The third Zeon mobile suit is nowhere to be found.
<br><br>
Fifteen minutes later she found her faithful Type 74 and together they continued their journey.

Things had not gone as planned for anyone these past few days, and Chris Burnett was no exception. Like so many others he'd been cut off from the Lucifer's Fury as it escaped along with the ZMF resupply fleet. Now he did all he could to sneak the massive Braw Bro around the Earth Federation fleet that barred his way. 
<br><br>
"Of all the times, they're adjusting their positions now?" Burnett grumbled, watching three of the four Magellans of the Ohm fleet move in order put themselves to the fore of the disabled one. He smiled as he realized their intentions, "Putting your best face forward huh?"
<br><br>

<br>
On the bridge of the Titan, space seemed too quiet. The crew knew that not all of the Zeon forces escaped, but finding them was proving quite difficult, and now they had a disabled ship to look after. As all eyes remained peeled for anything out of the ordinary, the eerie silence of space filled the ship as well.
<br><br>
"We're never gonna find anything until the minovsky particles thin out..." One of the spotters muttered as he stared out into the vast emptiness.
<br><br>
"Oh come on man, minovsky particles don't make things invisible, just keep look-hey what's that?" Another replied, now fixing his view on the unknown object. The other spotter also trained his eye on the mystery machine, zooming his binoculars in to find a Zeon symbol emblazoned on it's hull. As they studied it carefully, trying to mentally match it with known Zeon units, it slowly began to move. "Sir, we've got a live one here!"
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Ah hell!" Chris cursed aloud, barely evading a mega-particle blast from of the Titan's lower cannons while the other Magellans began to rotate into firing position. Reflexively dispatching a wire guided cannon as he increased speed and made a run for it. He didn't make it far before a gleaming rain of mega particles showered down around him, forcing him to dodge and weave, ultimately turning back toward the fleet. The feddie gunners were good, though hard pressed to land a hit, they corralled the Braw Bro into a position where escape was all but impossible. 
<br><br>
"This is rediculous..." Burnett said to himself, "What I need is a diversion..."
<br><br>
The disabled Magellan seemed just the thing, and with a thought, the Braw Bro's arsenal opened up on the crippled ship, creating a vision-obscuring explosion cloud. Chris saw his chance, and made a break for it, but Basque was one step ahead. As the Braw Bro cleared the cloud, it's way out was blocked by the Titan, lined up for a full broadside. Ohm smiled darkly as the space in front of him lit up with high-energy mega particles, shredding the mobile armor in seconds.
