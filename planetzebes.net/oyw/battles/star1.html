<br>
The Amazon rain forest is still burning several days after the Zeon attack on Jaburo.  In an effort to reveal entrances to the hidden Federal capital, the Terrestial Assault Force rained napalm and incendiary weapons upon the land.  Both EFGF and TAF forces collide in the raging inferno, spilling death and destruction upon the rich soil.
<br><br>
Ironically, it was not by land that Zeon infiltrated the Jaburo base.  Elements of the Zeon naval forces lead by ace pilot Char penetrated the base through an underwater passage.  This fighting force managed to fight their way into the heart of the Jaburo complex.  They saw the massive buildup of Federal war machines hidden from Zeon intelligence.  But before the Zeon soldiers can do any damage, they are found and repulsed by Federal defenders.
<br><br>
Bright Noah can still see evidence of the fighting outside the conference room windows.  Construction crews and machinery are doing their best to repair the facility.  Bright thought the White Base would be part of the massive fleet resting in Jaburo's spaceport.
<br><br>
"What do you mean the White Base is going to be a decoy?!" demanded the captain of the Pegasus-class ship.
<br><br>
The senior Federal officer coughed before repeating himself.  "The <i>White Base</i> is to immediately launch into space to begin support operations for our space offensive.  The <i>White Base</i> and her crew are to distract Zeon attention away from our main effort by proceeding towards these coordinates."
<br><br>
Bright pointed at the chart.  "That's the complete opposite direction of the fleet!"
<br><br>
"Correct, you will rendezous with the fleet once they are in position to attack their objective.  Dismissed."
<br><br>
A few moments later, Bright Noah leaves the conference room with Sayla Mass and Mirai Yashima.
<br><br>
"I don't know who wants us dead more," remarks Mirai," the Duchy of Zeon or our own people."
<br><br>
"Either way," sighed Bright," we need to get Amuro and the ship ready... by the way, what was that all about back there?"
<br><br>
"Hmmm?  Oh... before the war... I was engaged.  When the war started, he left for Side 6.  It was an arranged marriage though between him and I..."
<br><br>
As they walked on, Sayla kept quiet.  Her brother is out there and now doubts cloud her mind...
<br><br>

<br>
Hours later, a man watches as the blue Earth sky turns into the darkness of space.  It has been far too long since he's been up here.  Someone spoke up from behind him.
<br><br>
"Commander, we have confirmation on the signals we saw going up from Jaburo.  It is the <i>Trojan Horse</i> sir."
<br><br>
Char Arznable turns around and gave a nod.  "Good work Tokwan.  Prepare the <i>Outer Heaven</i> for combat."
<br><br>
"Sir," said Tokwan," I request permission to sortie as well.  Having two mobile armors in the field will ensure the destruction of the <i>Trojan Horse</i>."
<br><br>
Char gave the man a look.  "Very well, permission granted."  He looked over at another officer.  "Prepare to launch mobile suits!"  The Zanzibar Kai accelerated as it races to catch up with the <i>White Base</i>.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"<i>Amuro, it's definitely a Zeon warship,</i>" said Mirai over the radio in the Gundam's cockpit," <i>and it's closing fast</i>."
<br><br>
"Any mobile suits?" asked the newtype pilot as he straps himself in.  Something felt odd to him however.
<br><br>
"<i>Two huge ones and what looks like two regular mobile suits</i>," said Sayla in her G-Armor.
<br><br>
Amuro looked up at both women on his video screens.  "Is something wrong?"
<br><br>
Neither women looked at him.  "<i>Nothing</i>," they both said.
<br><br>
The Gundam pilot barely had time to wonder before his mobile suit is thrown out into the darkness of space.
<br><br>
From the bridge of the <i>White Base</i>, Bright saw the two light sparkles as the Gundam and G-Armor spun around and headed towards the chasing Zeon ship.
<br><br>
The ship captain glanced at the man casually leaning on a bridge console.  "I know you just transferred onboard Mr. Sleggar, so I'm only going to say this once:  I do not tolerate inappropiate touching of my female officers."
<br><br>
"I honestly think you have something bigger to worry about," suggested Sleggar," we need to turn around and give some heavy fire support."
<br><br>
"You may outrank me Sleggar, but I'm still captain of this ship!  Stand by on weapons."
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"We're closing in on the Federal ship!"
<br><br>
Char watches as the two Rick Doms accompany the Zakrello and Bigro Mobile Armors on their attack run.
<br><br>
<i>Sayla... I hope you're not on the </i>Trojan Horse<i> now...</i>
<br><br>
The Gundam and the G-Armor clashed with the Zeon attackers in a vicious exchange of missiles and beams.  Amuro opens fire on the Bigro only to be surprised by the mobile armor's manueverability.  Sayla pulled the G-Armor away as the Zakrello and the Rick Doms made passes at her.
<br><br>
She looks up to see the enemy Zanzibar Kai begin to open fire on the <i>White Base</i>.  Then the G-Armor shook as it is grabbed by something large.
<br><br>
Inside the Bigro's cockpit, Tokwan grins as he slowly closes the mobile armor's claw.
<br><br>
Sayla powers up her mega particles only to be struck by the thought that Char may be piloting the mobile armor.
<br><br>
Suddenly a pair of cannon fire forced Tokwan to lose his grip on the G-Armor.  Kai and his Guncannon came barreling in with weapons firing.  Miharu's death still pains him but Kai realizes that he can't dwell on it forever.
<br><br>
As the Guncannon's entrance briefly stalls the Zeon attack, Amuro grabs the drifting G-Armor.
<br><br>
"<i>Sayla!  Are you alright?</i>" asks Amuro.
<br><br>
"I'm fine Amuro... who do you think is pilotting that thing?"
<br><br>
"<i>Huh?</i>"
<br><br>
"Nevermind.  I'm going to head back to <i>White Base</i> they need help."
<br><br>
A scattering mega particle blast brought their attention back to the battlefield as the Bigro and Zakrello resumed their attack.
<br><br>
Amuro threw his shield in the Zakrello's face, crushing its mega particle cannon.  As it sped past, he draws a beam saber and stuck the ignited beam into its belly.
<br><br>
He watches as the odd looking machine spun and began to explode.  A sense of danger suddenly flashed in his mind as the Gundam is tackled.
<br><br>
Inside the Bigro's cockpit, Tokwan laughs outloud.  "Let's see how you handle the NEED FOR SPEED punk!"  The Gundam pilot clenches his teeth as the Bigro rattles the Gundam through a series of high-g manuevers.
<br><br>
On board the <i>Outer Heaven</i>, Char sees the Gundam being distracted.  He jabs a finger at the bridge crew.  "Press the attack!" he orders," bring us to ramming speed!  All guns fire as she bears!"
<br><br>
Bright Noah saw the Zeon warship accelerate even more.  "Oh bloody hell!  Mirai!  Full starboard turn!  Sleggar, here's your chance!"
<br><br>
The Pegasus-class ship turns slowly as the Zanzibar Kai-class warship closes in.  Small AA turrets on both warships open fire on each other, chipping at the armor.  Missile ports on the <i>Outer Heaven</i> opens and soon missile rippled from their hatches.
<br><br>
"INCOMING!" shouts someone on the <i>White Base</i> bridge.
<br><br>
"Gotcha!" exclaims Sleggar as he slams his fist on the weapons console.
<br><br>
The <i>White Base</i>'s main cannon roars under Sleggar's control.  The shot struck the <i>Outer Heaven</i> amidships, nearly sending Char crashing into a bulkhead. The Zanibar Kai overshot the <i>White Base</i> as it drifts away.
<br><br>
Tokwan saw this as he slowed down the Bigro.  "T'sch, there goes our Rick Doms too.  Never send a boy to do a man's job."
<br><br>
He looks down at his captive.  "Poor kid probably passed out-"
<br><br>
The Zeon officer never got to finish that sentence as Amuro vaporizes him with a beam rifle shot at point blank range.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
As the Earth grew smaller and smaller behind them, the <i>White Base</i> limps forward on its mission.  Bright Noah gave another sigh.  Already the ship is damaged and they just left Earth.
<br><br>
Elsewhere on the ship, Amuro walks with Sayla down a corridor.  "Hey... why did you ask that?"
<br><br>
"Huh?" said a confused Sayla.
<br><br>
"You asked about the pilot back there... why did you do that?"
<br><br>
"Well I-" said Sayla as she tried to come up with some excuse.  Fortunately, one came to her.
<br><br>
"...Hey there!" greets Sleggar," isn't it our resident beautiful G-Armor pilot?  Great stuff back there."
<br><br>
The towering man looks up past the two pilots.  "Oh hey there Mirai!  Just about the hit the showers... wanna join me?"  He winks at the ship's helmswoman.
<br><br>
Mirai just turns her head away and walks away.
<br><br>
"Huh," pondered Sleggar," how about you Sayla-?"
<br><br>
But she is gone too, leaving an alarmed and confused Amuro.
<br><br>
"Well, I guess it's just you and me kid," said Sleggar as he puts a hand on Amuro's shoulder," your name is Amuro isn't it?  Let's hit the showers.  Kai and Hayato should be there too.."
<br><br>
A sense of dread sends Amuro's newtype senses ringing...
