"Move on my mark," Jim Irwin ordered confidently from his brand-new, experimental RX-78E, also known as the Gundam GT-4. It handled like a dream, was faster than any aircraft he'd ever piloted, and had <i>real</i> beam weapons. He just might have to abolish his "no mobile suits" rule now, he thought grimly. Oh, and his mobile suit apparently <i>transformed</i>, like one of those kids shows. He hadn't tried it out yet; he was a little nervous that all the switching around of parts and such would result in a crushed pilot. The machine was so damn smart, it might decide it wanted to pilot himself. Perhaps he could sub in a "no transforming during battle" rule to replace the one he'd lost.
<br><br>
He pushed all that out of his mind as the remnants of the Zeek fleet that had broken itself once again against the fortress of Jaburo, came into view
through the clouds. The bastards were stubborn as hell - he'd give 'em that. They were headed toward Jaburo again, obviously thinking that with some new trick, they'd manage to break the strongest Earth Federation fortress on Earth. Well, the Earth Federation had some tricks of its own, and his new GT-4 was not the least among them.
<br><br>
"Alright everyone, remember the plan: Snails on the sub, and Mantas follow me to the tanks - the big ones, not those piddly Magellans. With any luck, we'll be in and out almost before they know what hit 'em."
<br><br>
The Don Escargots chose the easiest of the Jukons to rain hell on, and the disabled Merlin sank beneath the waves one last time. The chosen Samson went down almost as quickly, and he imagined he could feel the heat from the explosion - though the luna titanium armor kept him safe from almost anything. He almost felt invincible.
<br><br>
"Irwin, we got trouble!" Mobile suits were piling out of the carriers, trying to shoot at their airborne tormentors. Apparently, the Zeeks weren't completely asleep. Still, he was basically invincible; he lined up another pass at a row of mobile suits, closed his eyes, prayed, and shot the beam cannons, alternating between them so he could get a shot off every 1.5 seconds instead of every 3.
<br><br>
The feel of bullets pinging off his machine instead of <i>through</i> it was heavenly, and Irwin sighed. He could do this all day long. Then, a pink beam tore through his wing, and he cursed the day that Minovsky had been born, almost tearing the control stick out of the cockpit as he pulled up and away from the heavy beam fire. <i>Damn mobile suits!</i>
<br><br>
As they made their way back from the successful hit-and-run operation, one of the Cod pilots asked, "Why didn't you transform into mobile suit mode? That would've kicked ass, I bet!"
<br><br>
Irwin just smiled, and said in his best fake-grumpy voice, "You know the rule: No mobile suits."
