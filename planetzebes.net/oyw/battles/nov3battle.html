Ando paced back and fourth across the bridge of the Dragon. "Are we in position?" Asked Ando. "Yes sir we just dropped the two Zaku K's and are now pulling back to a safe distance." Ando nodded picking up his fellow soldiers had given him a chance to ambush an evil Federation soldier."Good begin the operation."  he said before he turned to face an aide. "See to the needs of the soldiers we just picked up. I will attend them as soon as the operation is over." said Ando. With that his aide saluted and left. Leaving Ando to turn his focus back to the attack.
<br><br>
The two Zaku K's pushed forward as the Dragon pulled away from the drop zone. They knew the Federation pilot must have spotted the gaw by now.  As soon as the came in range they both locked their suits in firing position. Seconds later both Cannons began shelling the area.

Anton couldn't believe his luck. He just had to run into a gaw carrier all by himself. Or at least thats what he thought til it started moving away. "Where the hell is it going?' he asked. He paused for a moment to consider what to do when suddenly his suit was rocked by explosions. Acting quickly Anton brought up his tower shield and boosted back. But the explosions chased him as he went. By the time the attack had stopped Anton's Gm Ground was covered in dents and burns. It could have been worse he thought. as he looked at the charred looking remains of his shield. With no choice left Anton retreated further from the area to seek repairs.

<br><br>
3 days from Earth, a perpetual no man's land incorporating most of the densely populated (dense once, anyhow), Luna, and L3. The third ring of five, separating two malevolent parties from squashing the other beneath its boot heel, is what one would call the center of the Earth Sphere-aside from Earth, of course. Stars shine in all dimensions, the lunar plane the only major contender in this particular region. Just now it spins around the Earth, bringing the tides along with it.
<br><br>
A Zaku, peculiar in nature, was speeding somewhere-no where-but suddenly stops. Persephone Dawn, still struck by the stellar beauty of space cannot help herself. Having spent little time away from Granada, this was a treat. Surely, good things would come of this.
<br><br>
As if to mark the occasion, Caleb DeGrau, SAF toughguy, ruined the moment by appearing moonward and opening a communication channel. "Hey, so, I was told you'd be here."
<br><br>
"I knew you'd be here." Dawn said flatly, not really paying attention.
<br><br>
"Let's just do this. Do it or lose it."
<br><br>
The Zaku with more arms than really necessary, lunged, torso forward (mimicking something that had occurred not too long ago), but instead of a kiss, the Zaku planted a sharp jab into the Gelgoog's right pauldron with one of its clawed arms. It tore a sizable chunk from the awkwardly green armor. DeGrau was quite clearly stunned by the maneuverâ€”having been the aggressor all his life, it wasn't too often someone beat him to the chase.
<br><br>
Instead of gawking all day, he unloaded 90mm rounds into the Zaku's torso, creating hollowing tinking noises despite the emptiness of space. Dawn retreats, still unphased. Her reaction time seems uncanny, and DeGrau cursed at how little he's hitting her now. The ungainly Zaku stayed in the Gelgoog's blind spot, peppering its pray at every turn.
<br><br>
Finally, DeGrau's had enough. He stopped dead. Dawn, still jinking and diving from before, overshot just a hair and the Gelgoog grabbed hold of one of her manipulator arms--more luck than skill. The thing seemed to writhe in anguish as DeGrau swung it into his vulcan's firing arc and let loose. 50mm rounds struck the Zaku from head to toe.
<br><br>
"Hey babe, this ain't no Gre<i>nade</i>-a," sneered DeGrau, poking fun at what little he knew about her.
<br><br>
Dawn ignored him.
