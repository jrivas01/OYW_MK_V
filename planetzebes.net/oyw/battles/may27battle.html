<br>
It has been a good week.
<br><br>
A lone Rick Dom II sped across the emptiness of space away from the Zeon and Federal battle lines.  The former Zeon mobile suit had all of its old markings removed which allowed a mercenary like Malak Lazarevich to operate a little more freely.
<br><br>
The gun-for-hire is content for the moment.  His last two jobs with Veronica Wu and the Duchy of Zeon had paid off.  The Rick Dom II he is sitting in will get him farther in future contracts.  The money he was paid doesn't hurt either.
<br><br>
Still, flying around the Earth Sphere in a Zeon mobile suit isn't quite safe yet.
<br><br>
Something in Lazarevich's instinct told him to hide.  The Rick Dom II swung behind some debris that had drifted from the major combat zones.  The gun-for-hire powered down to minimal settings and waited.
<br><br>
At first nothing happen.  Then movement.  In fact, a lot of things moved.
<br><br>
Federal space fighters flew close.  The Saberfish are quickly followed by GMs and GM-Es.  Lazarevich cursed underneath his breath.  It is the Luna II Defense Fleet.  He had hoped to go around their blockade but apparently that isn't going to happen.
<br><br>
At least he's safe where he is.  In the far distance Lazarevich can see the light sparkles of the Salamis and Magellan-class ships.
<br><br>
Well, sooner or later they will move on to another sector.  Until then, Malak Lazarevich is stuck.
