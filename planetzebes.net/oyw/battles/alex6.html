The iced tea in her hand wasn't exactly the greatest thrill, but after being shot by those Feddies, Colonel Veronica Wu couldn't help but feel that it was something so sublime to taste the drink again. The bandages felt tight against her skin as she listened to Steiner go over their plans. Every so often, pain surges through her body, but she tries to block it out. The very fate of this operation rests on her ability to lead, even while injured.
<br><br>
 The white board they had been using was covered in dry-erase ink and various notes. The photographs taken by Petty Officer 2nd Class Emil Myberg are scattered around the table, as the former Federation pilot took copious notes. He was still nervous, being in the shadow of two famed officers. The doubt of being selected for the mission still clouded his mind, but after his actions yesterday, it was clear to his superiors that he was the right man for the job.
<br><br>
In the corner of the room, however, was an unwelcome form. In her dealings with Lieutenant Steiner, Roslyn O'Hara has earned her spot in the briefing room, yet she is on edge. Her therapy has been going well, but this is a critical moment. She sips her coffee, her ears caught on Steiner's words and the back and forth between he and the beautiful and alluring MAF Colonel Wu. The actress inside her almost wants to respond, and ask the wounded and injured colonel if she's considered a career in modeling or acting.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Alex Sentara and Jack Murphy cruised the Federation base in their General Purpose vehicle. After the fiasco of the break in the previous day, they had been told to remain on high alert. While his GP had been made ready for his wheelchair, Jack Murphy found himself in the passenger's seat. His eyes, honed from being an artillery MS pilot during the ground war, were being used to keep a look out for those Zeon agents that had infiltrated the day before.
<br><br>
"So, have you seen the legs on Mackenzie, Jack?" Alex looked over at his fellow patrolman, his recently repaired artificial arm turning the wheel of the GP as they continued on their usual patrol. "They go all the way to heaven, man, all the way to freaking heaven. I think that's the real reason they've got me on patrol. Got to keep me away from her, so that others can ask her out." He laughed to himself as they continued to drive. Jack could do nothing but roll his eyes. Seems that Sentara was all talk. About as bad as the weird guy they've sent out to find the Zeeks.
<br><br>
Breakfister Turbulence strolled through the suspected Zeon district once again. His flashy uniform, a distressed Zeon uniform, seemed to stick out, even amongst the suspected Zeon supporters. Most of all, he's busy. Incredibly busy. Eyes peeled for any Zeon activity. Especially any Zeon activity that occurs behind the disguise of miniskirts.
<br><br>
Women were accosted by him, as he moved through the streets. A constant blur of innuendo and interrogation, as he kept at it. He absolutely needed to find a way to break into the Zeon secret base, and to find them before they could do any harm.
<br><br>
"Come, Comrade! You work too hard, have a drink with me!" Mikhail was pouring out round after round of vodka, as the Zeon technicians worked with Caleb DeGrau to finish the final touches on the Gelgoog. The mobile suit was nearing completion, and was actually starting to look like the weapon it was meant to be. Kamisky's own weapon was not nearly as complete, but it only appeared to be a few hours behind schedule. Caleb couldn't understand how Mikhail was an ace pilot, when all it seemed to do was act like a giant bear and drink constantly.
<br><br>
"Why don't you ever shut up, you idiot." Caleb muttered, as he ran diagnostics on the re-installed flight computer within the Gelgoog. After three days of his constant chatter, the noise was beginning to wear on Degrau's mind. Mikhail stood up, the bottle in his hand as he takes another swig from the alcohol. His large frame moved across the hangar, his demeanor going from easy going to harsh. His hand grabbed Caleb by the collar, and started at him directly in the eyes.
<br><br>
Laughter erupted from his form as he gave Caleb a rather large bear hug, and drank another large swig from the bottle, before releasing the Zeon pilot, and leaving him back to his work on the Gelgoog.
<br><br>
Despite the preparations for war, it couldn't interfere with Chris and Bernie. Together, they laughed and joked, relaxing while Al told them his stories about mobile suits. About how he wants to learn how to pilot one. To be like the famous aces Char Aznable, or the famed Federation pilot Aurem Senaiha. He displayed the youthful exuberance that comes with one so innocent.
<br><br>
Yet Bernie was himself conflicted. He was here on a mission for his nation, for the Duchy of Zeon, but found himself more closely drawn to his strange friend, and the pretty girl who's way of saying hello was by beating him over the head with a baseball bat. It was almost like a family had formed, deep within Side 6, away from the horrors of war.
<br><br>
Too bad that he was part of a team that had brought it all the way out here.
