"Haul yer ass and get that stuff in here!"
<br><br>
They've been digging for the past few days.  The garrison of the Zeon fortress of Kimberlite had heard the announcement from space.  A new low hit the South African base, as the news of defeat sank into their hearts.
<br><br>
But Neuen Bitter would have none of that.  As a veteran since the early Riah Revolution, Bitter has no plans to give up.  Too much blood of good Zeon soldiers has been spilled to allow him to surrender.  In a fiery proclamation to the Kimberlite garrsion, the hardy warrior found a new mission for those with him in the diamond mine.
<br><br>
Renewed with a sense of purpose, the morale of the base soared to new heights and work began.
<br><br>

<br>
While most of Kimberlite is hidden inside a depleted diamond mine, there are still numerous facilities on topside.  Most of these are communications arrays, transponders, and navigation points.  All of these must be removed or camoflagued if their mission is to succeed.
<br><br>
Underground, technicans scramble about as they analyzed the electronic emissions of the base.  One by one, the electronic signatures of the fortress faded until you have to literally be waving a portable detection device over a buried land line.
<br><br>
Neuen Bitter smiled with a sense of pride as he watch the men and women of Kimberlite do their work.  Someday, this base will be called upon to serve and it is Bitter's job to make sure it is ready when that day comes.

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>The <i>Perry</i> vs the 17th South African Air Patrol and the Green Crabs</b></font></center>
<br>
The taking and holding of enemy territory is paramount in military operations.  Going on the offensive usually means advancing forward, breaking through enemy defenses, and establishing your own frontier deeper inside your opponent's zone.
<br><br>
For the crew of the Big Tray-class <i>Perry</i>, this is the more mundane part of their advance into Zeon-controlled South Africa.  After pummeling their way through two Zeon patrols, the land battle ship has stopped to set up a forward base.
<br><br>
With the EFSF Grand Fleet absorbing most of the Federation's resources, the scattered units of the Earth Federal Ground Force must rally together before they can begin contesting enemy territory.
<br><br>
That is what the base at Kilimanjaro is for.
<br><br>
With the Big Tray-class battleship coordinating the effort, construction of the new Federal base began in earnst.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The EFGF's work will not go unnoticed however.  Concealing the construction of a new base is difficult and tricky at best.  Zeon Luggun reconnaisance craft easily picked up the Federal activity.  Within minutes, the 17th South African Air Patrol is speeding towards the location.
<br><br>
The Dopps went in low over the rocky terrain, hoping that they can take their target by surprise.  There's nothing like jets strafing your position to make you regret getting out of bed in the morning.
<br><br>
It goes both ways however, as 25mm rounds ate into the Dopp formation.  From above, the <i>Perry</i>'s vigilant Jet Core Boosters and Tin Cods tangoed with the inbound.
<br><br>
A short distance away, the Goggs of the Green Crabs looked up.  A short time ago, they prevented Charles Gano from enterring South Africa, but they are not sure about the much larger Big Tray.  They noticed the aerial dogfight and correctly guessed that time is short.
<br><br>
It was a Fly Manta that found them.  Like fish out of the water, they didn't stand a chance against the air-to-ground aircraft and the Dish that was coordinating the main batteries of the <i>Perry</i> on their location.
<br><br>
As the smoldering remains of the two Zeon patrols burn into the sunset, they at least cost the Federal ship time.  The <i>Perry</i> will have to resume construction the next day.

<br>
"Wow.." Kyle said, looking around at the group that had been gathered. The mine shaft was littered with bodies, all looking at the small group of men, standing atop a hastily made stage. Jonas was rallying his forces.
<br><br>
Jacobin looked out among them, his steely eyes searching for anyone who might assassinate their leader. No one would, of course. The Tories still had no idea they were even here. Close to a thousand men had been gathered, prepared for this, their moment of liberation.
<br><br>
Jonas gave his speeches, but he had never been too terribly much of a speaker. Keller led by example, he led by passion, and his demeanor gave more than any speech could bring. He looked out amongst the mob. They were poorly armed. Pickaxes, shovels, other blunt mining instruments. The men he had brought with him had guns and knives, but they were few. There would be many deaths this day. But the toll of blood would have to be paid, both above and below.
<br><br>
The chaplain came onto the stage and started to say the prayers that would take them into battle.
<br><br>

<br>
"Can't believe I'm stuck with this crap." McEvoy said, his voice raspy as he climbed the solemn mountainside. The air was thinning, even thinner than usual Martian fare, but Matt was a hard one, as was everyone in his team. Martian atmosphere was withstandable with some very simple fittings, a skin tight suit that served as double insulation for the body pressure, an oxygen mask, and a heavy coat to keep out the cold. But still, the height of Amador was pushing them to their limits. At its top Amador was about a fourth as pressurized as the sealevel of the planet. Even with their suits, they would only be able to operate up here for about an hour. But by then the battle would be over, one way or the other.
<br><br>
There were many of them, but they were simply the diversion. Many more were stationed down below. With them was a single Depagg mobile gun carrier. Or at least, it looked like a Depagg. The mechanics at Carson City had put it together themselves from a blueprint that had been stolen from Amadors garrison. It was their only piece of armor. Pilots had practiced with it for weeks, and the best had been chosen, a man named Kevin Gram. Gram was a crack shot, and one of the hardiest of the Free Men. McEvoy was happy to have the eight legged tank walking by his side. Even if their assault still looked grim.
<br><br>
Their target was the cosmoport of Amador. A section of the mountain had been shaved away, making room for the airfield and ship launching ramp, high atop the mountain. This area was the most heavily watched, and the most heavily guarded. The Amador garrison had a small number of tanks and transports of various types, and McEvoy and his team would pretend to be stealing these, when in reality they were just a diversion. The real assault was coming from below, Jacobin, Keller and the rest of them moving quickly in the chaos towards the top floor of the city. It had taken a long time to pull enough strings to make sure the elevators would get them that far, but they hoped to have the entire Martian government in irons in one fell swoop.
<br><br>
As they reached the top, McEvoy gulped, raised his rifle, and leapt over his cover. The rest of his band soon followed.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
It happened, and then it was over, in the time that a dream takes to move from start to finish. Jacobin rushed forwards, his team quickly killing every guard in their way. Keller had been expecting a heavier resistance, but MacAllister, the commander of the Amador garrison, had completely underestimated them. The might of the Martian jihadists was too much, their resolve completely unwavering. They overwhelmed everything they came across, and before Keller knew it, he was standing inside Mars' very own capital, the former governer of the planet in irons and kneeled before him.
<br><br>
While the city was in chaos that day, and many innocents on both sides were killed in the riots, within a day Mars would have a new government. It would be run by its own people, and was on its way to becoming the newest and proudest nation in the solar system.
