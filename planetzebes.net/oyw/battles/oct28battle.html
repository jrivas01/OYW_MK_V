<br><br>
"Quiet guys..." Noelle whispered over their closed channel as she and her squad slowly descended the mountain side. The agile Dom slide around the trees gracefully on its air cushion, the two zaku's followed a little more slowly, trying to not fall. "We're almost close enough, and keep in mind, we are not to engage. I repeat, do not engage the Feds. We are to retrieve a thorough and detailed scouting report on their head quarters and then disappear again."

<br><br>
"Northern Sector clear Corporal, activity is at a minimum, you are clear to proceed." The Zeonic radar plane soared high above the clouds, its blue color almost blending into the azure skies. The twin discs of the Luggan spun actively as it scanned the area for enemy units. 
<br><br>
As the pilot came to the end of its patrol, it banked wide left and doubled back to circle above the Federation's HQ. The plane's camera began clicking away as it took second to second photos of the base from its aerial view. The computer systems ran full speed as it tried to keep up with the information it was receiving from all the different sensors that continued to record the data.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
"Spread out, make it quick, Eagle 1 has gotten the majority of the necessary data. We just have a few things left down here to document then we need to retreat." The Dom motioned to the Zaku's at her rear to split to either side as she continued through the thick jungle. Trees were starting to become a nuisance as she zoomed in with her optical sensors to start capturing photos of the southern wall and several of the structures in the distance. Noelle didn't dare venture any further out of fear of showing up on radar, even in the thick vegetation. 
<br><br>
"Ok, let's pack it up boys, your girl is getting quite uncomfortable being this close to the Federation base with no back up." She turned her suit away from the shrouded base and made her way back to the foot of the mountain where she waited on her squad. "Eagle 1, we clear to move out?"
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
"Aye Corporal, clear all the way to the mountains. Be careful down there." The Luggan made one last circle around the base before following behind his corporal to spot her retreat. It was now his job to get his squad out of enemy territory safely and with as few snags as possible. "I got your back, see ya when I land!"

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>Markos Steiner, Rhett Paruta, and Yuji Takeshi Spar</b></font></center>
<br><br>
The three zeon suits were a fair distance from each other arrayed in a triangle formation. Markos and his gouf, Rhett and his Zaku K, and Yuji with his Apsalus I. Even though it was just a friendly spar between allies, they each wanted to win. And as if on cue they all three threw their suits into action at the same time.
<br><br>
Markos fired a burst of paint rounds from his suits finger machine gun towards Rhett. However Rhett reacted quickly and boosted to the side avoiding all of the rounds. Before Markos could act again the Apsalus I barreled towards him firing off a stream of vulcan rounds.  "Damn." grunted Markos as he brought his shield up. The rounds impacted harmlessly across it's surface, and Markos pushed his suit to the side as the Apsalus I flashed by. His finger machinegun spat fire after the retreating suit and found their target. Markos nodded in satisfaction as he saw a few rounds impact. However his focus quickly shifted back towards Rhett as a cannon round flew past his suit.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
Yuji felt the Apsalus I rock slightly as the Gouf's paint rounds splashed across it's sides. He quickly pushed the suit up to evade any more fire. After Yuji had gained some altitude he swung his suit around in a lazy turn. "This could be going bettering." he said. As advanced as the Apsalus I seemed, it lacked heavily in the weapons category. With a small sigh Yuji accelerated the Apsalus I straight down towards the two ms. As he shot towards and over Rhett he fired of bursts from his vulcans, managing to land multiple hits with paint rounds. But not enough to knock him out of the fight. Yuji then forced the suit back and fourth as he leveled off above the ground streaking towards Markos. Seeing little point in holding back Yuji fired off a continues burst into the Gouf. Not expecting such a direct attack Markos floundered. His hesitation cost him and paint rounds impacted on his suits chest before trailing up to it's head.
<br><br>
Rhett barely noticed Markos's suit falling onto it's back. He was too busy tracking Yuji who was once again trying for altitude. "Not this time." Was all Rhett said as a round tore from his cannon straight at the Apsalus . Yuji reacted quickly though and ducked under the round. It did have some success however as it forced Yuji to have to come in with less speed this time. "This is it!" yelled rhett,d as he fired both his 120mm machine gun and 40mm anti air gatling gun at the approaching suit. Yuji fired as well, emptying the last of his rounds at the Zaku K. Rhett's suit was rocked as rounds impacted across it's legs. While Yujis underside was splatered with paint rounds.  Having no way to continue Yuji was forced to yield. "Well I guess thats what you'd call a blast." Said Rhett

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>Ritter Novosad intercepted by 24th Fighter Division</b></font></center>
<br><br>
The Indian Ocean looks just like any other large body of water on earth.  But to a person born on a space colony like Unterscharfuhrer Ritter Novosad, the crashing waves commands your attention.  His men are relaxing as much as their discipline allowed on the tiny craft.  Their Panzergrenadier armor is locked away in containers for their trip.  It's not like they can swim with it anyway.
<br><br>
The SS officer reflects upon his arrival on Earth.  The mock battle at Athens Greece against that ridiculously long-named squad.  It was almost playful, especially when using rubber bullets against his Panzergrenadier body armor.  But he has faith in Gihren Zabi.  If Gihren Zabi thought that Novosad's Panzergrenadiers would serve the best on Earth then so be it.
<br><br>
The telltale sound of a helicopter caught Novosad's attention.  The Zeon Gunship Heli crossed over them.  In the distance is civilian craft holding the Marine platoon under Novosad's command.  Both boats were commandeered from their civilian owners to elude detection in their journey.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
The 24th Fighter Division continue their monotone patrol of the Indian Ocean.  Six Fly Mantas cruised below the watchful eye of a Dish control aircraft.  Suddenly, a contact fades in and out of the Dish's vigilante electronic eye.  Two Fly Mantas broke formation to investigate.
<br><br>
Novosad had his suspicions but nothing is more convincing than your Gunship Heli exploding in a thousand pieces to let you know that something is wrong.  The loud passing of two Fly Mantas made Novosad realize how futile resistance was.  With a shout that roused his trained men from their idle slumber, he and his Panzergrenadier team leaps into the water.  
<br><br>
Two pairs of 40mm strafing runs ate through the civilian boat.  The explosive rounds set off the stored Zeon munitions, causing a fireball that baffles the size of the small boat.  Debris rain down on Novosad's men as they dove beneath the waves, coming up for air between the debris and smoke in order to stay hidden.  Several of them didn't jump far enough and suffer injuries from the blast.
<br><br>
With luck, the Fly Mantas only circled twice before leaving.  With the planes gone, the Zeon elite soldiers lift their commander on board a floating plank.  Novosad's entire lift arm is ripped open, blood streaming over the body.  About twenty minutes later, the boat with the Marine platoon sails by.  They kept clear until now in order to avoid a confrontation with the Federal Air Force.  Now, they picked up Novosad's Panzergrenadiers and turn towards land.  Onboard they broke out the first aid kit to stabilize the injured.  They need now to replace their equipment and get medical attention.  Their mission is delayed but not yet over.
