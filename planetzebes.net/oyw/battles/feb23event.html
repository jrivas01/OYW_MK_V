<br>
Aaron McCaskey sat in the cockpit of his GM Land Type, playing with his moustache as he waited for his intended target to pass through Florence. He staged his mobile suit behind building wreckage from the initial bombardment by Zeon during the begining of the war. As he unintentionally messed up his moustache, he whipped out a small mirror and stared himself almost narcissistically. He noticed that his hair was unkempt as usual, and his moustache was slightly off, so he whipped out his small comb and made the necessary adjustments. After the straightening of his prized stache, he added some gel to enforce a hold.

<br>
The Ground shook as the infamous G-Force made their arrival, several units already launched, patrolling and Guarding the Eclair, Sammy and Berkhalter. Aaron knew this was not going to end well, but he was going to try to do as much damage to the fleet as he possibly could. He focused his aim, taking shelter in a damaged villa. He fired a shot through the top floor balcony, aiming for one of the patrolling Zakus.
<br><br>
The Zaku went down like a thai hooker as the shot tore through the armor. Three Xamels moved to face the origin of the shot, one of which was piloted by Alec.
<br><br>
"This is my favorite part." commented Alec, as he prepared the 680mm Howitzer in sync with the other two Xamels
<br><br>
"Make that little shit suffer!" shouted Omar Dillenbeck, the secondary Xamel pilot.
<br><br>
Bryce Hollerfelt remained silent, only following obvious orders to subdue the enemy. While bombardment began, units that could not get the enemy in their scopes, took shelter and insured that there were not enemies elsewhere. The Laggun flying overhead assisted with sending data to the pilots on the ground.

<br>
At first the bombardment was spread throughouly throughout Aaron's location but it came to surprise that in a matter of a few seconds his enemy managed to get his location, right to the villa. It startled him as he was only able to fire one shot. He focused his aim to try to get in another shot, but it was hard to concentrate with the villa coming crashing down on him. Aaron was soon revealed.As he fired, the shot whizzed past

<br>
Howitzer 680mm cannonfire and rounds from the Hidolfor's main cannon easily pierced the GM Land type's Armor. As the rounds tore through the armor, limbs were severed. In a matter of time, the GM Land Type was reduced to a limbless frame. G-Force's units eventually gave up on the bombardment, and continued onward as they were already held back.
<br><br>
Aaron stared at the sky, only to see the Laggun flying up ahead. He cursed his luck and reached for a med-kit to patch up a wound he recieved from shrapnel. After the bandages were placed, he looked at his cracked mirror only to see his moustache crooked once again.
