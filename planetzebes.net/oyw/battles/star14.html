The Earth Federation Space Force's Grand Fleet had cut a swathe through the Zeon forces that had opposed it, but it had finally met an obstacle worthy of its massive bulk. A Baoa Qu was an imposing figure, two asteroids merged to form Zeon's headquarters in space, hollowed out to hold its massive stationed force, the fortress was equipped to house, repair, and even build hundreds of mobile weapons. Thousands of men and women - Zeon's best - worked feverishly to prepare for the arrival of the Federation fleet, to "welcome them with Principality hospitality," as some said.
<br><br>
Against this fortress, its mobile weapons and ships, and its people, the Grand Fleet of the Federation sought to throw itself. Weakened by the resistance it had encounted, bolstered by those already stationed in space, it was an impressive display of the power of the Earth Federation. Increased resources meant more heavier deployment, and heavier deployment meant that the Federation could play the numbers game with Zeon, and they were exceedingly talented at the numbers game. Rows of the trusty GM lined almost every hangar in the fleet. The economics-driven war machine of the Federation had overpowered Zeon's, and the momentum of the war had shifted to match it.
<br><br>
The resolve of the Zeon Expeditionary Force did not waver, in the face of the most impressive fleet the Federation had been able to marshal since the war started. They were not the Zeon Evacuation Fleet, or Zeon Escape Fleet, or any of the other variations on ZEF that the Feddie pilots were throwing around. Still, they were wise enough to pull back the asteroid fortress when the Federation fleet neared; an expedition at this point would only expedite their own deaths, and Veronica Wu had not finished shining for her Sun.
<br><br>
The resolve on both sides was impressive, as were their numbers. The sparks that would fly in the impending engagement would send raging fires into the hearts of many, and would consume others. The hammer and the anvil were poised, waiting to see which would shatter when they were both tested.
