<br>
The Prince of Aargau coasted through space and Kajka Marecek could admit he was enjoying the moment of peace. He knew they were heading to engage an enemy unit, and couldn't help but feel slightly nervous. However before he could continue his train of thought Sarabajka. "We've located the enemy unit Captain." said Sarabajka. Kajka nodded to himself "Have the crew go to battle stations and inform Ms. Adelaide." replied Kajka.  He turned his captains chair to face the ships view screen. "So much for our moment of peace." he muttered.
<br><br>

<br>
"So do you think your plan will work?" asked Alice Simek as she locked her flight suits helmet in place. Upon hearing the question Nadia paused in her preparations and glanced over at Alice. "One can never know such things. Though I have recieved confirmation our support in en route." replied Nadia before she to attach her helmet. Glancing over one last time "Just be sure to stick to the plan." said Nadia before walking to her suit. Leaving Alice to her confusion at such a statement.
<br><br>
As soon as her suit cleared the Prince of Aargau she drifted forward and active her suits Minovsky Particle Scattering Equipment. As it began cycling on Nadia noticed Alice's GM E flash by. "I just hope she can stick to the plan." commented Nadia.
<br><br>

<br>
Emil sighed in relief for a moment. He had dreaded coming back into space alone again. But for the time being it would seem his mind was at rest. Still it wasn't all great for him. "Damn mine." he said angrily to himself. He couldn't believe the enemy would just hide inside like that. "Maybe I can get the drop on the next one." he said to himself. As he began to try to locate another one of the mines in the area his sensors gave off a small beep. Glancing down he noticed a small blip.
<br><br>
"What?" he said to himself as it vanished but a moment after he saw it. He quickly pressed a few buttons trying to find it again. But his attempt was interrupted as he suit was rocked by machine gun fire. Grabbing at the controls quickly he sent his GM E into a spinning dive to shake the fire. But no matter what he did fire stabbed at him constantly.
<br><br> 
"What the hell?" he yelled as his suit was hit again. He did his best to block the fire with his shield but he couldn't help but feel like he was being herded somewhere. Suddenly out of no where a GM E appeared on his screens. "Am I seeing things?" he asked himself as The GM E closed towards Emil quickly. "Do I shoot?" he asked himself. Hesitating for just a moment cost him dearly.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"I can't believe its working." Alice said excitedly to herself. And she opened fire with her suits machine gun and vulcans. Rounds tore into he hapless Federation suit. As it went to counter attack the six zaku's that had backed off before darted back in and joined their fire to hers. After nearly a second they stopped. "To the Federation suit, this is your one chance. Surrender or die." Radioed Alice.
<br><br>
Emil couldn't believe this was happening. But his action was clear, he had no love for the Federation. He just wanted to live. "Don't shoot, I surrender." he replied.
<br><br>

<br>
"[i]Saint James[/i], report in, please." Nigel Ferdinand was once more aboard the cramped flight deck of the [i]Chicken Little[/i], and frankly, he was feeling a bit rushed. The [i]Saint James[/i] had stopped billowing smoke, but it was very damaged, and thus the 42nd was only able to move as fast as its slowest vessel. They had made the journey on time though, and without a chance to rest, they were about to engage the enemy. An enemy who just happened to be about the size of a small castle back home.
<br><br>
Over the white and blanketed mountains they flew, sound muffled by sheets of snow speckled with rocks and other things of no immediate consequence. The GM Sniper team had already been set in position, and they waited only for the go-ahead from the command of the 42nd. Truly, it was a quiet locale, soothing to the mind, even if all the white stuff started to give you a headache after looking at it for too long. It was just over another misty peak now,  the imaginary border that signified the battlefield's boundaries. "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here," it advised when you passed it, and should you pass it again, it'd probably just be surprised to see you.
<br><br>
"Alright, men, I do believe this is the part where we attack. Stand by for my signal." The navigations officer nodded at Nigel, and the 42nd passed into the dense fogbank. They waited for a moment, anticipating the big reveal, for the curtains to be pulled back. An awkward silence filled the air as some time passed, seemingly too long for this dramatic moment. "...Pilot, you didn't happen to turn around did you?"
<br><br>
"No sir, I've kept 'er nice and straight."
<br><br>
"Well this is- Oh, well, there it is." 
<br><br>
Indeed, the clouds parted and a few klicks ahead, Zeon's monstrous Mobile Armor was visible. Hulking and menacing with spikes of green, it sat in a sea of white clouds populated by islands of snow and stone, all cupped in a mountainous bowl. Its back was turned to the 42nd passing out of the shrouding mists, and Yuji Takeshi was too late to notice them before Ferdinand gave the order. "SHOW 'EM WHAT FOR, MEN!"
<br><br>
Down below the clouds, three GM Snipers hidden by camouflaged tarps and snowbanks, coordinated their telemetry data and fired. The clouds were pierced by pink beams, leaving behind vortexed holes, but the snipers' aim wasn't true, and the glowing pillars passed by the Apsalus' body and into the stratosphere. Yuji was most certainly aware of their presence now. "Impertinent Federation garbage, always interrupting important matters. Very well, your lives will make for some [i]excellent[/i] data."
<br><br>
A Gouf on a Dodai II broke through the cloud sea's surface, as it had been waiting beneath the pooled whiteness, and it headed towards the 42nd's main flight formation. Yuji maneuvered the Apsalus, and began calculating targeting data for the Mega Particle Cannon. The Gouf cut up and above the main flight contingent, chased by three Jet Core Boosters and two Tin Cods. The remaining Tin Cods burst ahead of the formation and charged the Apsalus while the remaining aircraft began unloading all of their rockets and missiles towards the Apsalus.
<br><br>
Above the Apsalus and Medeas, however, the Gouf and Dodai, were quickly being out-maneuvered by the Jet Core Boosters, and was unable to hit any of the agile fighters. At last, all the fighters alligned and let loose a deadly salvo, and the Gouf and Dodai were annhilated completely. Fortunately, the Apsalus finally had its targeting solution and fired.
<br><br>
All the aircraft tried moving away from the massive beam, but the [i]Saint James'[/i] wounds meant that its survival was not meant to be. Along with two brave Tin Cod pilots and a singular Depp Rog, its skin boiled away, and its bones burned to nothingness, unable to survive a weapon rivaled only by the gods. Clouds superheated, expanding steam exploded out of the path carved in whiteness, quickly becoming a cool rain on the remaining ships. Nigel Ferdinand pulled himself off the flight deck's floor, knocked off his feet by the Medea's sudden acrobatics in dodging the MPC. He straightened out his clothes as he peered out the steamed up windows, and picked up the radio transmitter.
<br><br>
"All right, everyone, let's move in now, before it can fire another one those." He put down the transmitter and tried to catch his breath, and just as he had ordered, all the remaining pilots began to move in, intent on wreaking as much havoc on the behemoth as possible.
<br><br>
Yuji scoffed at their reformation and checked the MPC's charge. "Well, I suppose now would be a good time to pull back; that was an extremely satisfactory result." The Apsalus began to turn around, but it was caught by a barrage of missiles and rockets before Yuji could make his escape. "Worms!" He manipulatd the controls again, trying to take aim of one of the noisome machines. Another set of explosions rocked the Apsalus, and now it was pouring blackness out into the pure clouds. Yuji cursed, and gnashed his teeth, extremely motivated to take down another aircraft.
<br><br>
Sadly for its pilot, a Tin Cod swept in front of the Apsalus and was mowed down by vulcan fire. His life was traded for another mass of explosions shaking the Mobile Armor, and this time, not all of them were external detonations. "Damned Federation... this won't be the last of me!" The Apsalus shot back from the weaving fighters, and accelerated rapidly, chasing after the setting sun. It sank into the clouds, silhouetted against the orange glow, and then it was gone. Nigel Ferdinand and his 42nd let out a collective sigh.

<br>
The Pacific Ocean seem to stretch into eternity.  A vast plane of water that separates two very different worlds.  Ironic that these two worlds can come together in times of war.
<br><br>
Flying high several thousand feet in the air, the Recon Gaw <i>Excelsior</i> lumbers aggressively across the sky.  Squadrons of Dopp fighters swarm over its purple hull like angry bees. Bristling with more electronics than the usual Gaw, the Zeon aircraft dominates the area like no other.
<br><br>
It is the commanding power of the <i>Excelsior's</i> EWACs equipment that alerted the other half of the SS Tactical Operations Fleet.
<br><br>
Captain Marina Nixie Nimue took the message slip from her communications officer.  Her face tightens as she ponders the situation.  After a moment, a familiar voice spoke up from behind her.
<br><br>
"What's the problem?"
<br><br>
Obersturmfuhrer Xaviar Brennan stepped past other crewmembers of the <i>U-77 Lorelay</i> as he crossed the bridge.  Signs of stress still lined his face.  The bags under his eyes showed his restless rivalry against the Earth Federal marine mobile suit.
<br><br>
"Company," replied Marina as she handed the paper over.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
It is starting to become a very bad day for the crew of two different Dish aircraft.  The first to notice something is wrong is the 21st Anti-Submarine Wing.  The crew of the Dish aircraft was trying to zero in on a sonar contact when everything just went haywire.
<br><br>
To the north, a very similar thing was happening to the Hillock-class <i>Wave</i> and its Dish plane.  Both saw emerging detection values of two underwater contacts but now they can't make sense of their equipment.
<br><br>
Based on the little they knew, the Don Escargots flew off to launch their attack.  The <i>Wave</i> went to combat speed and began to prepare its torpedo launchers.  Very quickly, the depth charges began dropping from the Don Escargots.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
They can hear the sound of exploding depth charges grow louder and louder.  Xaviar Brennan grips the controls of his Z'Gok as he and the AcGuy launched through the baffles of the underwater detonations.  Raising through the disturbed water, they can see the <i>U-77 Lorelay</i> try to evade the barrage of depth charges.  To the east, the <i>U-88 Baekhesten</i> is under the same type of attack but to a lesser instensity.  It is only a matter of time though until the ASW aircraft corners the two submarines.
<br><br>
Not if the Z'Gok SS officer can do anything about it.
<br><br>
On the surface, things got much worse for the Earth Federal units.  The <i>Excelsior's</i> Dopps appear out of nowhere.  The air superiority fighters ate up the two Dish aircraft like stale crackers.  Then the Dopps bore in on the ASW aircraft.
<br><br>
Brennan saw three torpedoes splash into the water and chased after them.  Triple plumes of water flew into the air as mega particle fire meets high explosive warheads.  
<br><br>
The <i>Wave</i> was trying to do too much at one time.  Upon seeing the Recon Gaw visually, they began launching from their VLS racks while trying to swing its second set of torpedo launchers towards the underwater targets.  Smoke trails leap into the sky, but before the Hillock can launch more torpedos the first of 240mm surface to surface missiles struck true.  Torpedoes from the Acguy lifted the ship out of the water only for the Brennan to tear it apart in a coup de grace.
<br><br>
The dead Hillock's desperate missile launch surprisingly caught the Recon Gaw off guard.  Fortunately, the inaccuracy of the missile attack only dealt minor damage to the air frame but fatally caught some Dopp pilots offguard.
<br><br>
With the broken pieces of the two Federal patrols sinking into the dark waters of the Pacific Ocean, the SS Tactical Operations Fleet continues on its journey.
<br><br>

<br>
"Sir?"
<br><br>
"Yes? What is it?"
<br><br>
"The preparations are complete. The operation begins with your word, sir"
<br><br>
"Ah, okay. Thank you ensign. Dismissed."
<br><br>
The tall officer watched the reflection of a saluting man in the open glass window of the Lucifer's Fury's command deck. His heart sank a little at the prospect of the upcoming engagement, but as long as he believed in it, he would hold no qualms against it. These were seasoned men under his command and they would not disappoint, yet the thought of going up against a captured Gwazine remained touchy. Morale definitely took a serious hit, but through the careful inspirational talk and some tactful intimidation on the SS's part, the mental state in the Zeon fleet remained at acceptable levels.
<br><br>
Back in the hangar Zeon pilots were all either entering their suits or already completing preflight checklists. The usual plethora of experimental mobile suits was somewhat mitigated by the severity of the Prototype Gelgoog's damage so the already perturbed Caleb Degrau would have to settle for a mere Zaku II HMT. Naturally this didn't irk well with some who would give their right nut for a HMT model, but Caleb was above them. Hell, even now he was forgoing regulations and smoking a cancer stick. Inside of the Zaku, no less.
<br><br>
Yoritomo Naizan was a different scene. He was meticulous yet efficient with his checklist and he was actually the first on one of the launch catapults, taking the brief respite to collect his thoughts and try to envision how he would deal with the upcoming battle. The man lacked experience, but his fortitude would see him through. Well, hopefully it would, he thought.
<br><br>
A little while later, Richard Banks signaled the ship's communication's officer to announce to all forces that the rescue operation was now underway. Immediately the Jicco launched a single salvo of missiles at the Federation fleet "below" them and then high tailed its advanced location to began its trek back to the Tivvay.
<br><br>
The high explosive missiles flew straight through the lines largely undetected until their explosive payload detonated within the midst of the dummy balloons and the Narwhal. Almost instantly the deceptive Salamis ships ruptured and deflated, but the Narwhal was certainly more resilient and suffered only minor damage to its port side.
<br><br>
It was as if Banks personally stepped on a huge ant colony mound: the Earth Federation crew in each respective ship began to identify the source of the attack and organized a timely response to deal with the enemy. Telemetry data was fed to the gunnery stations and the Salamis cruisers began to orient their MPCs toward their noon, though the Narwhal's port gun near its bow could not move to match due to damage sustained. Not a moment later, a triplet of solid streams tore through the Federation fleet and managed to clip the already damaged Merrimack and making it combat ineffective from the get go.

"Charles! Cut that damn oldies music singing!" ordered the senior member of the marine detachment. The confines of the transport shuttle wasn't very spacious to begin with; four fully outfitted marine squads made the journey extra bothersome.
<br><br>
"Sorry, sarge," apologized the singing marine, "just, you know. We're about to get shot up, and I thought I could indulge myself in this little sin for a bit."
<br><br>
"Yeah sarge, rumor has it there's a crack Federation squad on that Gwazine," chimed in a third, darker skinned marine, making a shooting animation with his gloved hands.
<br><br>
"Heh, and we're gonna be stuck in this freaking tin can for a few minutes until we get there. Shoot, we're bout to get our asses blown off for the Zabis," muttered a fourth marine, taking a long look out of one of the transport's tiny view ports.
<br><br>
Gazing at a photograph of a woman, another said, "Man, screw them. I mean, damnit, my enlistment was supposed to end the first week of January. Then this shit. God damnit."
<br><br>
"Oh yeah? Well, I'll make sure to make your girl REAL cozy after I get back," offered the musical marine.
<br><br>
"Would you people just shut the <i>hell</i> up?"
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Inside the Gwazine, a flurry of activity was taking place as pilots ran out grasping helmets with a symphony of klaxons and warning lights going off all around them. The GM Sniper II and Guncannon MPT, however, were already ready to exit the hangar as their pilots had the foresight of being prepared for a possible attack.
<br><br>
"See?" Derek transmitted, a slight victorious ring in his message.
<br><br>
Grumbling, Michael replied, "Yeah yeah. You'll have your fifty dollars after this."
<br><br>
The two newcomers came to see eight enemy mobile suits coming from one vector and they were closing fast. With little time to spare, Kreuz whipped out his Sniper's rifle and discharged several rounds into the oncoming Zeon attack force, acting as a mere deterrent to their current flight plan. Back in the Gwazine's hangar, the the Gundam was surprisingly quick to leave its berth and move into open space, but it had a damn good reason to do so.
<br><br>
"Where is my Gundam? It was right here," asked the Issa Kobayashi.
<br><br>
The technician looked dumbfoundedly at the academic. "Um, Simmons told me that you were bedridden and that you authorized him to sortie with the Gundam, sir."
<br><br>
With a look of disbelief, Issa said, "Really now? Simmons told you that? Did Simmons also tell you that he's going to have my Ph.D holding fist in his face when he gets back?"
<br><br>
"Uh, no sir," stammered the man, "shall... shall I alert the MPs?"
<br><br>
Recollecting himself, the rightful Gundam pilot agreed and said, "Yes, go do that. Them and the medical orderlies."
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The Federation mobile suits had by now met their Zeon counterparts and began to provide a brilliant spectacle for any viewing observer. One of the red HMT models successfully pegged the Gundam in the torso, but the luna titanium armour mitigated the shot's effect, allowing the joyriding Marc to retaliate with a well placed beam shot through the Zaku's left leg. Seeing the dismembered Zaku, Michael leveled his rifle for a clean kill, but a verbal warning from the now entering Issa allowed the relative newcomer to barely dodge a downward swipe from another HMT and actually rifle butt the suit in the head. This stunned Zaku was immediately dispatched with a beam shot from the GM Light Armour before the latter strafed to the left to avoid a 280mm shell.
<br><br>
"Simmons, you are not authorized to pilot that mobile weapon!" shouted the Cambridge graduate while trying to make do with this surprisingly agile and responsive mobile suit.
<br><br>
"Fortune favors the bold, pops! And I'm bold!" Marc replied with confidence, albeit hurridly. He was busy dodging all these shots in the damaged Gundam, but he was clearly esctatic just being able to pilot the prototype. And while his extrasensory abilities were certainly helping, it was clearly evident that the luna titanium armour was the only thing keeping him alive.
<br><br>
Suddenly a beam rifle round came out of no where and had it not been for his uncanny instincts, the shot would have hit a rather vital part of the mobile suit. The Act Zaku was now in play and its pilot continued to fire the beam rifle at the White Devil incarnate. Yoritomo's frustrations mounted when he couldn't hit the Gundam, but Caleb would come in on a run to help Yoritomo line up a shot.
<br><br>
Firing his 120mm at the Gundam, the temporary HMT pilot flew past the Gundam while letting off a panzerfaust, forcing the Gundam to avoid the potent warhead and unsuccessfully shoot down its source. The Gundam shrugged off several more shots, but in doing so allowed the Act Zaku to lance it with a beam rifle shot and neutralize its entire left arm.
<br><br>
Michael upon seeing this, lined up a shot and fired at the Act Zaku and successfully pierced its skirt armour, and momentarily stunning the its pilot. A quick follow up shot followed but was sent awry when a bazooka shell nearly hit, and the blue high performance GM strafed to the right to avoid several more shells only to have its right forearm cleaved off by one of the regular Zaku II models. The sniper let loose a string of vulcan rounds to deter its attacker and was oblivious to a Zaku II HMT coming in for a death blow with a heat hawk, realizing his brush with death only after his suit was knocked forward from the exploding HMT.
<br><br>
"Just saved your ass, Michael," said the Guncannont MPT pilot before being rocked by a solid bazooka round.
<br><br>
"There's just too many of them! We can't hold out for much longer!"
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Sir, we wont make it to Ohm in time at this speed."
<br><br>
Isaac Lon'Dozai looked out at the nonfunctional MPC turrets and the overall decrepit state of the once proud Merrimack. It was a shell of its former fighting self and her captain knew that her crippled state was only slowing down the rest of the fleet. It was with the salvation of the fleet in mind that the Salamis Kai's captain ordered an abandonment of the ship in favor for its escape capsule superior speed. Yet just as the evacuation order had been placed, a triple beam barrage punched through the entire length of Merrimack. A moment later there was a terrifying large explosion in its stead.
<br><br>
The source of this excellent shot was none other than the Lucifer's Fury guided by no less than two high trained reconnaissance type Zakus. Maintaining a holding position far away from the mobile suit battle, the Tivvay was duking it out the entire ship compliment of the Damocles Strike Force. The small Jicco had completed a few more missile runs, but they were all shot down the the impressive array of AA coverage offered by the Gwazine. Now it was acting as a sort of bait to lighten the MPC fire that the Lucifer's Fury was attracting.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Already two of the shuttles had been destroyed en route to their intended target; two Zaku HMT models just weren't enough to deter the sheer number of AA guns trained on to the boarding party. Even the Komusai would fail to land its marine contingent as was unable to fire its damaged retrorockets and ended up cratering into the side of the Gwazine. Indeed, only one of the shuttles would make it near the Gwazine, and even that seemed to be suspect when a pair of Balls crested the top of the Gwazine and aimed their cannons at the vulnerable shuttle. But alas, the shuttle's inhabitants would live another minute as a sacrifice from the remaining Zaku II HMT destroyed the two Balls before being swiftly obliterated by the Gwazine's potent AA suite.
<br><br>
"God damn we just lost everyone else," observed one marine, seeing a bunch of dead and alive marines in open space.
<br><br>
"Y-y-y-yeah, I know," replied another, his teeth audibly clacking over the comms.
<br><br>
The master sergeant decided to interrupt and ask, "Shit Sutherland, you scared?"
<br><br>
"N-n-no, sarge," replied the marine in question, "it's just all this adrenaline, you know? Makes me j-jittery."
<br><br>
Charlie laughed and said, "This shit makes me hard."
<br><br>
Safely in the dead zone of the Gwazine's weaponry, the marines evacuated the only shuttle and began to attach themselves via magnetic boots to the hull of the Gwazine. Two of MAF's finest began to speedily attach breaching charges in a circular fashion on the red hull before facing away and allowing the shaped charge to work its chemical magic. In no time there was a nicely sized hole in the Gwazine's hull and almost immediate two of the marines threw in two flashbangs.
<br><br>
"Breaching!" shouted one of them, waiting until the flashbangs detonated before stepping inside. He scanned the corridor to his left while the marine behind him scanned the right, signaling the all clear to the other marines a few seconds later.
<br><br>
Not long after the first two marine groups infiltrated the Gwazine was first contact initiated. The lead element of the Federation security detachment had recently been dropped dead by a well placed head shot and now a vicious firefight was ensuing in the corridors of the ship.
<br><br>
"Charlie and Delta, proceed with your objectives!" shouted Alpha's leader. "Alpha and Bravo will tie down these Feddies!"
<br><br>
The latter two squads poured into the hole, sustaining a couple casualties in the process before they eventually made off toward the brig. With each corner turned, they were one step closer to rescuing Wu Jinyuan until the two squads met resistance from the second Federation marine contingent on board. Both sides did what their infantry training had taught them, but the numerical superiority of the Zeon forces at that junction would eventually rout the particular Federation squad.
<br><br>
An eerie silence pervaded the corridors
<br><br>
"Jesus Christ, what the hell happened to you two?"
<br><br>
"We, uh, we ran into some real badasses. They're dead, yeah, but uh, so is the rest of our squads."
<br><br>
"Holy crap, let me get you bandaged up then"
<br><br>
"No need, just, go on ahe-"
<br><br>
"CONTACT!" shouted one of the men on perimeter duty before dropping to a knee and firing his rifle.
<br><br>
Gunfire resumed down one of the corridors, only this time Rachel and Otaktai were opposing roughly two Zeon marine squads.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Richard continued to monitor the situation quite fervently as a new source of problems had just materialized in the past few minutes. The Ohm fleet was detected moving at flanking speed in an attempt to cover the Damocles' withdrawal meaning that the Zeon forces had a little under five minutes to conduct their business and leave before the full might of Magellans would be upon them. Opening a secure channel, he personally informed all Zeon forces that they had only a couple minutes before a general withdrawal order was in effect, shutting off the transmission only after repeating the message three times.
<br><br>
Sitting back down on his chair, the SAF officer looked anxiously at the continuing MS battle far away from the ship. Several massive MPC beams continued to shoot past the ship, but the speed of the Tivvay and the general lack of experience for the Federation crew on the Gwazine meant that there was very little chance for high speed interdiction vessel to be hit. Plus, the remaining Salamis ship had an equally inexperienced crew that could do nothing about the Lucifer's Fury and instead tried its best to eliminate the much closer Zeon MS.
<br><br>
To the SAF captain's surprise, several beam shots went across his bow from the direction of the approaching Ohm fleet. He ordered the Tivvay to begin the withdrawal and instructed the Jicco to expend the last of its missile magazines showering the area with an anti-beam particulate. No sooner had it done so several more beams approached yet were diffused by the substance, and one by one the Zeon mobile suits were seen returning to the Lucifer's Fury.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
It seemed like a good idea at first. Then a decent idea, then a questionable idea. With several bullets ricocheting off the bulkheads so close to them, Rachel and Otaktai were unanimous in agreeing that this was now a very, very bad idea. The young native American stuck his assault rifle around the corner to blind fire only to have a cascade of Zeon bullets knock the weapon out of his hands. Immediately he looked down at his hands and moved his fingers to make sure they were all there before announcing the idea that the two should withdraw at once.
<br><br>
"You think?!" Rachel shot back, having better luck with blind firing by incapacitating two marines as if she was magic or something. "You go first, I'll cover you!"
<br><br>
Otaktai nodded and calmly walked away from the firefight causing the newtype to shake her head at his cool. With him safely gone, Rachel got up to prepare her own tactical withdrawal from the firefight, but with her magic still strong, she decided against going down a certain hallway as it was suddenly filled with flying lead. It was clear that they were trying to flank her, but she wasn't going to have any of that, so she backtracked while covering her movements with her sidearm.
<br><br>
Turning a left around corner, however, would be the last thing she remembered. Either that or the black polymer buttstock that implanted itself into the side of her head. The Zeon marine responsible for this pushed her unconscious body to the side and disarmed it before rejoining the rest of his squad at the brig.
<br><br>
There, a certain Wu Jinyuan accepted a pistol given to him and then began to follow his saviours through the maze of corridors that he knew all too well. A short stop at a locker room for space suits and the Gwazine's original bridge crew were on their way to freedom. Two minutes were remaining for the marines to extract and it almost looked like they would make it with time to spare until the previously routed Federation marines blocked their avenue of escape. Still, the Zeon marines maintained slight numerical superiority and fought through their Federation counterparts, successfully routing them for a second time, and made their way to the extraction point.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the firefight had cost them dearly in time, and to make matters worse the shuttle that was waiting for them erupted into a fireball, one of the marines pointing out a single Saberfish fighter zooming past the Gwazine. Just then, another firefight erupted behind them and the surviving Zeon marines were quickly taking on casualties with no real means of escape from the advancing Federation security forces.
<br><br>
The sight caused one of the surviving Zeon marines to spout out a collection of rhetorical questions. "What the shit?! Where's our support? The hell is this?"
<br><br>
"This looks like surrender for me," Sutherland remarked rather solemnly.
<br><br>
"And another capture for you, Wu Jinyuan!" joked Charlie, pointing a finger at the MAF officer.
<br><br>
"..." Wu said in response.
<br><br>
"Charlie... shut the hell up," said the sergeant.

Giddy with his first and possibly only sortie in the Gundam, Marc Simmons failed to take into account the possible repercusions of his actions until now. It was no problem, though, as he would smooth everything out just perfectly. To his surprise, however, two MPs were out to greet him when he opened the Gundam's hatch, but before he could open his mouth to explain, a fist came down into his nose.
<br><br>
"You uncultured ass," Issa muttered while watching the two MPs struggle to contain the narccist.
