<br>
The journey is hard but must done.  Across the lands of East Asia, a single blue mobile suit edged forwards step by step.  Private E2 Ota Naomi sighs to herself as she took another drink from her canteen.  Memories of the Battle of Odessa came back to her.  The trench and how it shook from the Federal artillery assault.  Next to her were Ferusha Glavadeen and Cima Garahau as they fought off the enemy heavy tanks and the "Invincible Third".
<br><br>
Despit their best efforts, their position was overrun.  Ota had hid at that moment, playing dead in hopes the Federal forces would overlook her.  Despite the shame that lingered over her conscience, the ploy had worked.  Now, in a brand new Gouf Custom she journeys to regroup with other Zeon forces.
<br><br>

<br>
But like all quests, Ota's journey would not be uneventful.  The powerful and loud footsteps of a mobile suit are easily picked up by a Federal Type 74 armored vehicle.  Within moments, the five Type-61 tanks of the "Mongolian Armored" turn on their diesel engines and rumbled forward to intercept the intruder.  Federal marines climbed onto their Bloodhounds as they took out their M136 anti-armor launchers.
<br><br>
Ota spotted the dust kicked up by the tracked vehicles a good distance away.  She turned the unfamiliar controls and ran to meet her attackers.  Even though this is the same mobile suit as her old ones, it handles differently.  The 75mm gattling gun on her shield began to spin up in earnst.
<br><br>
As one, the column of Type-61s turned.  In a great salvo, their 150mm smoothbore cannons boomed.  Ota ducked and dodged most of the shells as she showered the Type-61s with bullets.  Two tanks exploded outright.  A Bloodhound is flipped over, spilling screaming marines into the maelstorm of bullets from the gattling shield.  Missile trails from the other two Bloodhounds force Ota to evade.  As the hail of bullets stopped, the remaining Type 61s open fire again.
<br><br>
Some of the tank rounds impacted her shield and Ota responded with her 35mm arm machinegun.  It is a race against time as the small armored vehicles try to down the ground attack mobile suit before it killed them.
<br><br>
But Ota is not a pilot fresh out of the academy.  With a whine of engines, the Gouf Custom launched itself into the air.  Beyond the elevation of a Type-61's guns and beyond the reasonable reflexes of a soldier with a rocket launcher, the Gouf Custom flipped over and open fire.
<br><br>
Tanks and APCs exploded left and right as 35mm and 75mm rounds peppered the ground.  For good measure, Ota landed the Gouf Custom ontop of the Type 74 just as the panicked crew was about to flee.
<br><br>
With a smile of satisfaction, Ota turns the Gouf Custom back on her original heading.  Then the ground erupts around her in a pillar of dirt and debris.
<br><br>
The Jet Core Boosters of the "Sumatran Air Corps" turned around for another attack run.  As four of their unleashed their 25mm vulcans and 50mm cannon, two of them lined up their missiles.  The explosions from the ordinance are only interrupted by the pumping of the Gouf's projectile weapons.
<br><br>
Ota tries to track the fast moving shapes but she is already running low on ammunition.  Finally submitting to the inevitable, Ota began retreating.  Her weapons kept firing to keep the Federal aircraft away.
<br><br>
A few minutes later, the squadron leader of the "Sumatran Air Corps" called it off.  They are running out of ammunition and fuel themselves.  Both sides departed as silence washed over the East Asian lands once again.
