<br>
The cell in the center of the island compound stank, the aroma of fresh urine wafting across low and poorly lit ceiling. At this point a host of less than reputable individuals were hanging around outside the door, amounting to the 433rd Basterds and an entire division of heavily armored Panzergrenadiers. Inside the room, the bandana-clad Tael Thorn looked up weakly, a scalped and dead Marine that was formerly under his command slumped and bleeding on the floor beside him. Looking into his eyes with an angry glare was the picture perfect Untersturmfuhrer Xavier Brennan, every hair on his head and every dangling ornament on his soulless black uniform in order. Quietly, Xavier stared into the mans eyes, pulling his freshly polished Mauser C96 out of its italian leather holster.
<br><br>
Ritter was standing outside the door at attention when he heard the shot. There was a cold thump shortly afterwords, and a visibly unmoved Xavier Brennan opened the door. Xavier looked Ritter in the eyes, the Panzergrenadier quickly moving out of his officers way.
<br><br>
"Caught the prisoner trying to escape." Brennan said, coldly. At the back of the hall, Donny turned the corner, no longer proud of the baseball bat resting on his shoulder.
<br><br>
"Well shucks." Donny muttered, leaning his back against the wall, his body going limp with disapproval.
<br><br>
"He sure did escape you, din't he." Aldo said, making love to the cigar that was straddling his lips. The three Basterds shuffled off to the corner of the hall as the troop of SS marched past them in single file. Many of the Panzergrenadiers stared at the three MAF members as they went, putting as much emotion as they could in front of their masks.
<br><br>
"I don't like them sometimes sir." Donny said after the group had passed. Hugo moved on ahead, taking off his cap and holding it to his breast.
<br><br>
"They're just doing the good lords work." He responded, a fake accent and an exxagerated swagger in his step.
<br><br>
"Well, vacation times over you two. Time to get back to the war." Armistad said, following behind them.
<br><br>

<br>
A few miles from Manila, a small group of Federation mobile suits and tanks marched, moving uphill in enemy ground as fast as they could. Jarvis was enjoying the quiet of his mobile suits cockpit, finding it much more suitable to him than the deck of the aircraft carrier. Not that he wanted to see it go, but there were good things about his command being at the bottom of the ocean. The plan was simple enough. They were going to distract the base defenses long enough to allow Tael and his men a chance to make a run for it. It was the least he could do, Jarvis mused.
<br><br>
Their group consisted of four GMs, four Bloodhounds carrying a marine strike team, and a single Type 61. It had been raining heavily the entire day, and the hilly terrain surrounding Manila, coupled with a spectacular lack of forests, jungles, trees, or other vegetation of any sort, made the ground muddy and difficult to traverse.
<br><br>
"Sir, you know it's going to take me hours to clean the gunk out of the tracks later." Ion yelled, her voice echoing through the hull of the two man tank. Cray snickered, half amused and half annoyed, it was obvious that his driver knew how to deal with machines much better than people.
<br><br>
"Are you listening to me sir?" She asked again, the tank rumbling as it came up on the ridge where they were to attack. They hadn't been seen yet, something the group was very lucky and thenkful for.
<br><br>
"Yes I'm listening. Please focus on the task at hand." Cray responded. He didn't like this sort of engagement, he'd rather break down their front door and push in as hard as he could. However, they simply did not have the forces to do that anymore.
<br><br>
Almost the instant they came up over the ridge behind the base, the patrol of Dopps circling Manila saw them. Alarms were raised, and Zaku pilots began to scramble to their machines. Jarvis held out his machinegun, hoping to use the few seconds he had to damage some of the bases more sensitive systems. However, the Dopps were too fast, sending machinegun shells and missiles onto their position. Quickly Ackart raised his shield, the GM Command covering the more vulnerable Bloodhounds and Marines from the Dopp assault.
<br><br>
"Christ they're like bees." The Englishman scowled. Oh how he hated bees.
<br><br>
More Dopps launched as their air support came into view, a pair of heavy bombers and a trio of Don Escargots coming from the Pacific. A large group of Dopps turned towards them, enveloping and eating them like piranhas in a small pool. The veteran Don Escargot teams were able to shoot down several Dopps before being destroyed, their AA complements much more impressive than their strange looks would bely. However, it was not enough, and the Dopps quickly won the day. The rain hampered the Duchies air superiority more, turbulance and poor visibility preventing the strafing runs on Ackarts position from being very effective.
<br><br>
After the initial shock of being attacked was over, Cray and Jarvis opened fire on the base, shells slamming into the pavement of the compound even as the base defenses made their reply. Zakus, AA guns and stationary cannons fired onto Jarvis's position, clods of muddy dirt exploding all around him. Two rounds sliced into the GM Commands arm and shoulder, forcing Ackart to move backwards. As he pulled his shield back Cray's tank was uncovered, and missiles from Manila's Dodai bombers struck the top of the tank, causing it to catch fire.
<br><br>
"Ion how bad were we hit?" Cray yelled over the noise of the guns firing. His cannons struck one of the Zakus in its mid-section, which keeled over slightly before exploding.
<br><br>
"I think the rain will put it out. We can't stay here long sir." Ion responded, pulling the tank back slightly as the hill in front of them was acquainted with a bazooka shell.
<br><br>
"Lieutenant, our men can't advance with all that air support." The commander of the marines yelled into his radio. Some fifty infantry personnel had gathered at the edge of Ackarts shield, their Bloodhound transports behind them. They were launching handheld rockets into the base, but doing very little damage.
<br><br>
"Alright." Jarvis said. "We'll hold till you get your men back in the tanks and then we'll retreat. Cray, launch it on my mark." Ackart pulled his suit up slightly, throwing a grenade before loading his rifle. By now mega particle beams were coming at them, the Goggs having dispatched the lone GM Diver occypying them and arrived from the port to assist in vanquishing the land-based intruders. A bazooka shell hit one of the GMs on Jarvis' left squarely, the mobile suit toppling over with a smoldering hole in its chest, the pilot obviously slain.
<br><br>
The Federal marines started pulling back to the Bloodhounds when small arms fire began sailing around them, pinning them in position. A group of SS and TAF marines on Wappas were flying up the hill, their hovercraft ignoring the rain and muddy ground and allowing for perfect maneuverability. Each bike was equipped with a 50 cal machinegun, allowing the lot of them to pour lead into their targets indiscriminately. At the head of the group was Ritter Novosad, the crimson-eyed and masked warrior pushing his throttle and sailing towards the enemy. Jarvis fired on the Wappas with his machineguns, several men being killed as the 100mm shells hit the earth beneath them, but the Panzergrenadiers ignored the explosions and kept coming.
<br><br>
One of Ritters men grabbed a bazooka, firing it while piloting his bike. One of the Bloodhounds behind the Federation position was hit, exploding and popping across the base of the GM Commands shield in pieces. The EFGF soldiers returned fire, rifle shells ricocheting off of the armored plates of the Schutzstaffels finest warriors. One bullet managed to strike Novosad in the gut, finding its way between two parts of his carapace, but Ritter ignored the wound. The group of Wappas sailed onto the ridge, the SS men throwing grenades into the Federation position. There was a number of explosions, infantry men dying even as the Panzergrenadiers leapt off their bikes and went to ground, slaughtering marines in and around the safety of Ackarts mobile suit. Several men fired shells into the side of Crays tank, completely disabling its treads.
<br><br>
"Crap." Jarvis muttered. The Zakus were advancing now, he had to retreat or there would be even more captives to worry about. He slung his rifle onto his suits back, magnet bands automatically detecting the weapon and locking it into place. Refusing to lose any more men, Jarvis grabbed Cray and Ions tank and picked it up in both hands, trying to cover it with the GM Commands back as he dashed back down the ridge, ignoring the slaughter that befell his marines at the hand of the SS.
<br><br>
For a good ten minutes the Dopps pursued him, rattling the surviving GM and GM Command with shells but unable to do any permanent damage. After a while however the planes were running low on fuel and turned back.
<br><br>
"If I put you guys down can you move?" Jarvis asked. They'd already made it to the next island, and were moving as fast as they could for their rendezvous point, a small cove at he southern end of the Phillipines.
<br><br>
"Ion, is the tread working?" Cray asked, trying to keep himself oriented properly. The tank was sideways and being held in mid air by a mobile suit after all. Out of the side of the hatch Ion peeked her head, covered in oil and fresh bruises.
<br><br>
"Yeah, I think so sir." She responded. Cray gave Jarvis the green light, and Ackart put the tank down, which squeamishly began moving through the muddy ground once again. It looked like they were going to get away. It was just then that they saw the three Doms on their flank, quickly outmaneuvering them on the water, close to the shoreline.
<br><br>
"Boy, we sure made it to Federation territory quick, these puppies are fast!" Hugo said sarcastically, aiming his bazooka and firing. Ackart responded quickly, covering Cray's tank with his shield. The 360mm shell struck true, all but destroying the titanium shield.
<br><br>
"Wonder if they know their friends already dead." Donny said, firing a shell that landed in the ground beside them. "Don't suppose they'd be up fer' a baseball game after work, do ya boss?"
<br><br>
The three Basterds skated around in front of the Federation units. Jarvis' GM Cammand and the one remaining GM the team opened fire, but were unable to hit the expert MAF pilots. Donny and Hugo both fired on the GM, one shot striking its shield and the other piercing its reactor. The mobile suit exploded, Cray and Jarvis pulling back as Aldo's Dom landed on the beach.
<br><br>
"Not sure there's gonna be enough left for baseball Donny.." Armistad smirked, aiming the beam bazooka carefully. Just then the Type 61's cannons fired, Cray striking the Dom S squarely in the head. Aldos camera was destroyed, his mobile suit taking a step back to right itself just as he fired. The huge stream of mega particles went high, boiling the top of the GM Command but failing to do the intended amount of damage.
<br><br>
"Cray, fire the package now!" Jarvis yelled, the Englishman pushing Donny and Hugos units back with the last of his machinegun rounds. Cray launched a group of grenades and a missile from the weapons canister attached to his turret all at once, flashbangs and an M-particle bomb going off all around the 433rd Basterds. Donny and Hugo covered their eyes, surprised at the idea of using the Doms own tactic agaisnt them.
<br><br>
"I can't see shit sir!" Hugo yelled. Aldo's camera was already blown, but the radar was now completely useless, a dense field of minovsky particles having been released around them. When the Basterds came too, the GM Command and the Type 61 were already gone, having used their jump jets to sail over the next ridge.

<br><br>
Life had been pretty exciting for the crew of the Hillock-class <i>Gwydion</i>.  As part of the 87th Integrated Fleet, they sieged Manila for several days until its unexpected relief.
<br><br>
Then in the warrior's spirit, they have chased down the Manila interloper and sank the U-85.  The successful retribution raised the spirits of the crew and the damage that they took was treated as honorable battle wounds.  Now as they loiter in the waters of the Phillipines, they began to wonder what the future holds for them.
<br><br>
Today brought some welcome interruption to their monotonous schedule.  A local fisherman have made contact with them with the simple intentions of bartering fresh food.  Trading with native populations have been a business for seafaring voyages for centuries.  Although the coming of the modern age of frozen foods, replenishment by sea, and preservatives declined the frequency of transactions, oppertunities still present themselves.
<br><br>
The fisherman stops his boat a few hundred yards away from the <i>Gwydion</i> as a rubber dinghy is loaded with EF marines.  From his wooden boat, the fisherman watches as the Dish and Don Escargot aircraft lift off.  He can tell the crew of the Hillock is relaxed as the Marines casually poke around the fisherman's boat.  Confident that there is no trap or armed militants onboard, the <i>Gwydion</i>'s quartermaster began bargaining with the fisherman.
<br><br>
Half an hour later, the EF dinghy finishes ferrying the crates of ice-packed fish, fresh fruit, and fresh vegetables over to the <i>Gwydion</i>.  The fisherman waves back at the EF crew who are no doubt happy about all of the food they got for some trinkets in return.  Particularly the red apples.
<br><br>
Oh, well.  The fisherman made good of his loss with the money Scarth Maheart gave him.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
Speaking of the rogue in question, four hours ago Maheart was lying on the hood of his truck <i>Ultra Magnus</i>.  Stan Bush's "Dare" is playing on the car radio as loud as it can go.  He watches as two pilots in EFGF uniforms climb onto two Tin Cods with EFGF markings.  Together, they took off down the runway of the civilian airport.  In moments, their EFGF IFF equipment are switched on.  Maheart bites into a red apple, lost in thought.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
They stored the crates of food in the flight hangar of the <i>Gwydion</i> for now.  What this meant for the two aircraft is that only one of them can land on the Hillock until all of the crates are transferred below deck.
<br><br>
Neither air crew is bothered by this; it's a small sacrifice for fresh food.  Onboard the Dish aircraft, an operator raised an eyebrow.
<br><br>
"What is it?" the flight officer asks.
<br><br>
The operator points at the screen.  "Tin Cods sir, from the southwest.  The codes are a little dated but they check out."
<br><br>
They both shrug.  "Good to have an escort I guess."
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
The fisherman looks up and sees the trails of two fighters passing overhead.  That was his cue.  He calmly dials a number on his prepaid cellphone.
<br><br>
In one of the crates, in a hidden compartment under all of the ice and fish, a cellphone rings.  The detonation of all of the explosives unknowingly brought aboard the ship erupts in a massive explosion.  The flames shoot out of the open hangar door and blew out the walls.  The <i>Gwydion</i> lurches, the bow jutting into the air before settling back down again.
<br><br>
Within a minute, Maheart's two Tin Cods pounce on the unsuspecting Dish.  Vulcan fire ate through the aircraft, causing it to plummet into the sea.  By sheer luck, they lost sight of the Don Escargot.  Confident that the burning ship is going to sink, they leave her to her demise.  Ammunition is expensive for rogues and the Tin Cods leaves before real Federal aircraft arrives.
<br><br>
It took a brutal six hours of firefighting before the last flame was extinguished on the <i>Gwydion</i> as the day ends.
<br><br>

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>RF-4 Captured</b></font></center>
<br><br>
The Ruins of RF-4 mining base stood out like a sore thumb in South Africa. It used to be a proud mining base, but had recently fallen undo some rouges control. Unbeknown st to them, Zeon was coming to reclaim it.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
Rhett sat in his cockpit enjoying the last few minutes of silence as he made some last minute corrections to his aim. He glanced at his wrist watch before settleing back into his seat. "Thirty seconds left, not bad." he said. As the time ticked closer and closer down here thought back to the briefing.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
Ando pointed on the map. "This looks to be the best position for you to provide support Rhett." said Ando. Rhett nodded before Ando continued. "The plan is simple, you will provide an opening barrage aiming for their lone ms. Then myself and Marko will launch our attack from here." Finished Ando. 
<br><br>
"Don't worry if you miss the zaku Rhett. Just focus on putting them off their game." Chimed in Marko. "I got it." said Rhett.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
The timer in his suit gave a small chime as the counter reahced zero. Rhett exhaled slowly as his suits scope settled over the zaku guarding the mine. "Goodbye." said Rhett and he pulled the trigger. His Zaku K lurched as it's cannon opened fire.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
Marko saw the rounds fly over his suit and strike the mine. "Go!" he shouted from behind a dune where him and his team were crouched. Moving quickly Marko pushed his suit and hurtled the dune altogether. Closing the distance quickly he entered the mine within seconds. He swept his rocket launcher back and fourth but couldn't see anything.
<br><br>
Glancing back he saw the two Zaku II J's had caught up with him. Motioning with his suits hand they pushed forward.  He caught brief sight of Ando and the Gouf from Rhetts team as the dropped off dodai's on the other side of the mine. "Come on we can't let Ando beat us to the center." Marko said to his team.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
Ando and the Gouf with met up with Marko a few minutes after they dropped. All they'd managed to find of the defenders had been a lone destroyed zaku. "Anything?" Ando asked Marko. But Marko's suit shook it's head. Ando had thought their would be more defenses. 
<br><br>
"Look out!" he heard Marko yell. Reacting quickly Ando rotated his suit around bringing his shield to bear. Just in time for multiple rpg's to slam into and explode.
<br><br>
Marko saw the rpg's slam into Ando. Quickly tracing them back he saw they came from a damaged looking building. Without hesitation he brought his 280mm rocket launcher up and fired two rounds. His zaku II J's and the Gouf joined in with their weapons. Within seconds the building was torn to pieces by the combined fire power. "Ando are you ok?" asked Marko with concern in his voice.
<br><br>
"Don't worry, just scratched the paint some." said Ando who's suit appeared rather unharmed except for some scaring across his shield arm. 
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
"Rhett, this is Ando. We've secured the base so go ahead and come in." Said Ando over the comm. Rhett confirmed and sighed a little as he began making his way in. "Nice to have an easy win once and a while." he muttered to himself.
