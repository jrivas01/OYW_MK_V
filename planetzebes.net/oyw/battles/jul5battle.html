<br>
Security was extra tight within Libiot colony, as Gundam Alex was going its final preparations. The Federation was taking extra precautions as a Musai rumored to be the legendary ace pilot Char Aznable's, was sighted in side 6. Avoiding the catastrophe that almost happened in Green Noah was both in Riah's and the Federation's best interests.
<br><br>
As the Gundam Alex seemed to be almost perfect, its learning computer was not. Like its pilot, both had great potential and skill; however they were lacking in experience. Christina Mackenzie was specifically assigned to the Alex to train the learning computers and test pilot it. The unit's original purpose was to be piloted the legendary newtype, Amuro Ray. 
<br><br>
"Lieutenant Junior Grade Christina Mackenzie, Ensign Sentara here has requested to spar with you. We believe having a veteran test out the Gundam Alex in simulation would be very beneficial for the learning computer and great opportunity for you." Informed Dick Lumunba, head of the NT-1's development.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Pleased to meet you, Ensign Sentara." Said Christina.
<br><br>
"The pleasure is all mine, Lieutenant." Replied Sentara, smiling. In his head, he was admiring how attractive Christina was.
<br><br>
"Very well, let us begin with the simulation."  Suggested Dick. "If you will follow me."
<br><br>
"Sure thing, dick." Replied Alex as he handed Lumunba a jump drive. "Here is my combat data."
<br><br>
"Thank you." Replied Lumunba, as he then sighed. Christina only rolled her eyes.
<br><br>
"Go easy on me." Said Alex, who then proceeded to chuckle.
<br><br>
Christina ignored him, and just entered the simulator. "Is that...a Saberfish?" asked Christina, both puzzled and slightly insulted.
<br><br>
"Do not underestimate him, he survived Odessa in that relic." Added in Lumunba
<br><br>
"Alright..." replied Christina, as she adjusted for the lack of gravity, beam rifle in hand.
<br><br>

<br>
Alex shot forward in the Saberfish II, harassing the Gundam Alex continuously with Vulcan fire, to which Christina replied to by seeking shelter behind the Gundam's shield, and firing shots at the fighter in the distance. The Vulcan fire of course harmlessly bounced off the luna-titanium reinforced armor, and Sentara struggled to dodge the stray shots from the beam rifle. He did a good job thus far, surprising Mackenzie, just as much as he himself was surprised by her accuracy. A shot managed to scathe the left wing of the Saberfish II, but it was not a direct hit, and only managed to burn part of the armor coating, as it whizzed on by.
<br><br>
"Not bad kid...I may have to step my game up a little bit and actually try." Announced Alex, as he listed to the right to avoid more shots.
<br><br>
"Kid? Who are you calling kid?! Must I remind you of your rank, ensign?" replied Mackenzie, with a hint of bitterness
<br><br>
"Hey! Hey! Hey! Back in my day, people respected their elders." Jested Sentara, performing a barrel roll and releasing a volley of anti-ms missiles at his enemy.
<br><br>
"I'm pretty sure you are only a couple years older than me, gramps." Jested Mackenzie, as she subdued the missiles with fire from her Gatling guns. 
<br><br>
"...and that was your second mistake..." commented Alex, as he performed a vertical U-turn to face the Gundam's back.
<br><br>
However, Mackenzie had predicted his movements, and pulled of a 180 degree turn, in record time to block the sprays from Alex's vulcans. The Gundam's magnetic coated joints and 360 degree panoramic cockpit had come in handy.
<br><br>
"...so this is this is the strength of the Gundam...that unit is a beast." Thought Alex, as he desperately tried to avoid more beam rifle shots.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
As Sentara approached the Gundam, he fired another volley of Anti-MS Missiles straight into the shield, destroying it completely. In response, Mackenzie withdrew her beam saber with her now free hand, and tried to strike the Saberfish II as it flew over her head. Alex narrowly dodged, and by the time he pushed on his breaks, she was once again facing him, and spamming her beam rifle. With haste, Alex fired the anti-beam rocket that created a cloud of particles that reduced or completely nullified the incoming beams.
<br><br>
"...how about a game of cat and mouse?" offered Sentara, as he shot his final volley of anti-ms missiles at the now surprised Mackenzie. 
<br><br>
Mackenzie fired her Gatlings, but Sentara evaded successfully, as the concealed weapons were no longer a surprise to him. Sentara then pushed on his thrusters on maximum, not caring that he wasting fuel due to the extra tank he had equipped. He slowly led the Gundam Alex into a mini digital asteroid field. Mackenzie continued to fire her Gatling guns, aiming for the annoying little saberfish. Shots that weren't wasted on random chunks of space rock, struck the rear side of the Saberfish II, urging Sentara to respond quickly.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"...and there is four and five." Said Alex as he ejected the fuel tank, which then slammed into the charging Gundam, halting its movement.
<br><br>
"Au revoir, Mon Ami" said Alex, as he fired his only Anti-Ship rocket, straight into the fuel tank he had just ejected

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>Pirates in Space</b></font></center>
<br>
In the vastness of space no one can hear you scream and no one can hear your mobile suit blow up either. This is where the Black Rock Pirates make their home. Out here in space they hone their skills and venture out into space looking for stuff to steal and people to fight and piss off along the way.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Today was different however. Today two of the pirates decided to spar with each other, instead of looking for booty, they were going to do a sparring match to see who is better or not. They loaded up the paint rounds into their guns and bazookas and vulcans.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The two modified Rick Dom II's were in the battle field awaiting for someone to make the first move. Robin Swayer wsent first unloading his vulcans at Samuel Riley's Rick Dom II. Samuel dodged the shots and fired all of his bazooka rounds and vulcan ammo at Robin. There was no way for Robin to dodge them all in time so he dodged some of the bazooka rounds before the vulcan ammo clouded his main monitor and allowing the rest of the bazooka ammo to impact against his mobile suit.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Sastified with his victory Samuel flew off to get his mobile suit re loaded with normal ammo.
<br><br>
<center><b>Outcome: Samuel Riley Victory</b>
<br>Samuel Riley: 4VP gained, Repairing 1
<br>Robin Sayer: 2VP gained, Repairing 2</center>
