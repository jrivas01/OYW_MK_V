<br>
Looking like some sort of bizarre comparison chart, three mobile weapons were lined up according to their size. First was the impressive if oddly named Gouf, piloted by Duncan Keystone. Not far from him was the fearsome artillery monster known as the Xamel, manned by Alec Irusk. Finally, a massive, bizarre machine with an equally confusing name, The Adzam. Newcomer David Anderson sat in the unique mobile armor, waiting for the signal to begin the mock battle. 
<br><br>
"All right lets see what this baby can do!" He shouted as the air horn blared, wrenching the controls and skidding the Adzam into a tornado spin as it began to lift off the ground, flinging snow into a cloud of white haze. His more experienced opponents pulled back from the blinding spectacle. The Gouf sprayed a few rounds from it's finger guns as it retreated, breaking away to attempt to flank the faster Xamel before it could find a firing position.
<br><br>
Alec Irusk chuckled to himself as the Gouf rushed to block his path. His Xamel spat some 20mm paintballs at the blue mobile suit, and switched to his missiles to prepare for the kill. He locked on, and fired a volley, but was shocked to see them explode in mid-air, cut down by a hail of reduced-strength beam fire from the tornado.
<br><br>
"Good, this is almost like the real thing..." he thought aloud, weaving further away as the spinning Adzam scattered beams everywhere.
<br><br>
"Good God, he's gotta be getting dizzy in there..." Keystone muttered, juking back and forth in his Gouf, unable to pursue the Xamel, even after a stray beam clipped the artillery suit's leg. Sure enough, the spinning was taking it's toll on poor Anderson, and soon the Adzam jerked to a floating halt, for all of a second. As quickly as it had stopped, it launched forward in a mad dash toward the Gouf, still spewing beams with reckless abandon. Keystone took aim, but the speed of the mobile armor, combined with it's now circling strafe, made it difficult to keep pace with.
<br><br>
"I'm faster but he just never stops moving!" Duncan complained, forcing the controls even harder as the crosshairs finally seemed to line up.
<br><br>
"Bingo." He said, pulling the trigger for but a moment before a massive explosion of snow, dirt, and red paint washed in front of his view. The carnage wrought was unbelievable for a practice round, but such was the nature of a 680mm paintball fired from Zeons largest mobile artillery cannon. Amazingly, the shot missed it's mark, but Keystone knew that Irusk would fire again soon, and wasted no time taking evasive action. Sadly with his focus shifted, Anderson took advantage of the opportunity and scored several hits on the blue machine. The order was given to power down, Keystone was out of this fight.
<br><br>
Irusk quickly switched his aim, searching for the restless Adzam. Finally catching sight of it, he let loose a salvo of missiles, all missing and painting a red swath across the snow, but drawing the Adzam into a more manageable flight path for his cannon.
<br><br>
"You handle that machine well, but you have much to learn." Irusk said, pulling the trigger and sending another monstrous paintball streaking toward the mobile armor. With a horrendous thud, the two-foot diameter ball of paint splattered an almost blood-like red over the gigantic machine, making it look even stranger and leaving a surprising dent in it's hull.
