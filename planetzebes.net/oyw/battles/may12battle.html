"A Magellan this deep? Damn the feddies! Send men to battle stations and scramble mobile suit teams! Get Dozle Zabi on the line!"
<br><br>
Alarms were going off all over the Gwaden. Men tumbled out of their cots, madly rushing for the hangar bay. The influx jammed the hallway, as men screamed to get to their MS. The 0 gravity only made things more dire. A more slender pilot did his best to climb over the traffic. His name was Anavel Gato. He burst past the crowd and entered his mobile suit, a Rick Dom II. Recently refitted in Zeon's 'United Maintenance Plan', a number of attitude verniers created unparallelled maneuverability.
<br><br>
"Anavel Gato, Rick Dom II, Launching."
<br><br>
The lone mobile suit exited the Gwazine, heading towards the formidible battleship. The green hulk sailed through space, directly at the Gwanzine - yet did not open fire. The courageous lone mobile suit lifted its 360mm giant bazooka, flashed the enemy bridge with its scattering particle gun, and prepared to fire.
<br><br>
"For the success of the ideals of Zeon, for the pride of the Zeon Space Attack Fleet. Magellan, You shall not pass!"
<br><br>
Five bazooka rounds went sailing towards the enemy ship, all directly for the center. They struck, causing an immense explosion, tearing the ship in half. Gato quickly recognized that the rest of the ship was not vaporizing - but melting. ANOTHER balloon. How dreadful. The bridge of the Gwaden looked on in shock, as it seemed Gato took out a Magellan in one shot. Aguille Delaz chatted up Dozle Zabi about his immensely skilled Magellan-killer. Dozle was very pleased, talking about how to reward him. Gato was not about to correct them.
<br><br>
"Magellan destroyed... Gato returning..." His heart sank.

There had been a lot of water put between the Lorelay and Alexandria, but the events still managed to play through her head like an old black and white film. Fortunately for the young captain, the waters did nothing but ease the pain. 
<br><br>
"It'll be alright lass..." A concerned voice came from the shadows as Hans Bond stepped out from the shadows just behind her chair on the bridge. Marina nodded, knowing he was right; or at least that she needed to get to that point. She stared blankly at the front of the bridge, no one said a word to her.

High above the serene waters the Federation's EWAC Dish aircraft loitered lazily above the clouds. The crew had been actively scanning the Ocean since they had gotten word of the two contacts that had passed through the East Asia sector. Their computers were reading sonar buoys and radar responses revealing every little thing that entered their waters.
<br><br>
circling below the radar craft, a trio of Don Escargots stood vigilant, awaiting any sign of enemy activity; they were ready to take out any naval threat that decided they wanted to trespass in their area. Little did they know they were about to bite off more than they could chew.
<br><br>
<i>PING</i>
<br><br>
"We have contact!" The dish crew relayed their readings to the Don Escargot wing, who in turn began dropping their own sonar buoys to ready for their attack. At first a single sub appeared on their radar, and their mouths began to water as they armed their depth charges, their eagerness slowly dissipating as 4 more large signatures appeared on the radar; two more submarines, and two signatures about half their size.
<br><br>
"What the hell..." One of the pilots muttered to himself as the water exploded abruptly in a hail of missiles. The Don Escargot team tried to roll out the way, their Depth Charges were in the middle of being deployed, and fell, off target, into the chaotic ocean below. 
<br>

<br>
"Ma'am, depth charges in the water!" The radar tech looked back at his commander as he kept one ear to his head phones. 
<br><br>
"Maintain firing depth. Deploy MSM, take those damned pests out of the sky." Marina barked orders, not missing a beat. "Have the U-53 and U-101 dive, get them out of here!"
<br><br>
As the young captain directed her fleet, the flashing red beacons of the depth charges created a light show as they sunk lower and lower into the murky ocean, raining around the two other submarines. The U-53 tried to veer off to the right to escape the charges, the lights flashing more rapidly as they descended. Before the captain of the ship could brace for impact a flurry of torpedoes appeared out of nowhere. 
<br><br>
<b>BUUUUUURRRRPPPPP!!!</b>
<br><br>
"Hot Damn!" Gil Krundle exclaimed as he crushed a beer can against his head excitedly. He wasn't much use against those darn planes, but he sure as hell could take out some things with his torpedoes.
<br><br>
<b>Ptssssss</b>
<br><br>
He opened another can in celebration of clearing the depth charges off the Jukon II and began to chug it. Luckily for Gil his side kick was on top of things and moved to dispatch the depth charges falling on the other Jukon. A flurry of bubbles was released as the torpedo tubes opened and the Ace Grabro unleashed its arsenal. The area surrounding the U-18 exploded as the depth charges were prematurely detonated.
<br><br>
"Shit!" The Captain of the Jukon grasped his chair as the sub rocked in the water, one of the depth charges had gotten too close before the torpedo dispatched it. The submarine was in tact, but the hull had taken a little more damage, unfortunately. The two Jukons were escorted out of the area by the Grabro twins.

<br>
"Fire another round, blow them out of the sky, I grow tired of this." Marina sat down in her chair, she had her orders, and these pest were just becoming a waste of her time. One last wave of missiles erupted from the water, spraying mist everywhere as they burst into a storm of smaller missiles. The Don Escargot pilots cursed as they realized they couldn't escape the swarm of missiles that engulfed their planes.
