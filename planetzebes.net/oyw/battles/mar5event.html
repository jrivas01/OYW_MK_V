"So you said the ship is the mineral trading vessal <i>Aurora's Bliss</i>? I can't find any documentation on such a vessel, sir. While y'all obviously just peaceful traders, we've been on alert due to reports of raiders in the area, so I can't let you inta side six if you're not on our records. Whoever sold you the registration ripped y'all off or somethin', don't know why else it wouldn't be here." The Riah patrol functionary shrugged.
<br><br>
Manuel Garcia, acting admiral for the hodge-podge Black Rock Pirate convoy, merely nodded and said "Sorry, didn't mean to be no trouble. We'll be on our way; guess one can't trust much nobody these days."
<br><br>
"Wish I could help you, sir. But rules are rules."
<br><br>
The two groups of ships drifted back apart into the inky black of space, the Pirate's journey into Side 6 blocked for now.

Malta, or what was left of it, stood like a coffee stain on the desk of the Mediterranean. Onto that dark blot of land rolled a trio of Type 61 tanks, headed by one Staff Sergeant Cray Vermillion. Cautiously creeping through the grounds of the ruined base. All was silent, it was the perfect scenario for an ambush, but nothing was happening. 
<br><br>
"No one's home, I guess the Zeons forgot this place." One of the tank drivers muttered over the radio.
<br><br>
"Set up defensive positions, in case their memory improves." Cray said, instructing his driver to back his tank into a hard to see gap between buildings, aiming the turret toward the easiest path for a mobile suit to enter the area from. Soon, all the tanks were hidden either by their surroundings or by camouflage netting.
<br><br>
"We'll do this in shifts, two crews guard, one crew searches the base for anything important the Zeeks might've left behind. Bravo team, you're first, be back in two hours." Cray commanded, returning to his tank as bravo team quickly but carefully entered the first broken building in the compound.
