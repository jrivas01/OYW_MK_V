<br><br>
The four members of the Federation ground forces had been lucky to find this small island in the pacific ocean. It proved to be the perfect spot to carry out their spar today. They'd split up as soon as they had made land. A MP Guntak, Gm ground sniper, Aqua gm, and a team of marines were now caught in a game of cat and mouse.
<br><br>
Jack guided his ms through the jungle as best he could. "Just great. This fits my suit perfectly." he said sarcastically. His MP Guntank rotated back and fourth, as he went trying to find one of the others. He was starting to get annoyed until he say a light patch of blue through the tress. "Hirsch." Jack said with a grin on his face. He quickly fired a burst from his 105 mm arm machine guns. It looked as if he landed a few hits. As his suit began to roll forward in pursuit. it was struck multiple times with paint rounds from the side. Unfortunately for Jack, the spar was over for him.

<br><br>
Aurem gave a small nod as he reloaded his 100mm machine gun. It'd been lucky to catch Jack off guard like that. And ass soon as his gun was reloaded he pushed his suit forward, and burst through the trees into the clearing Jack had been firing at. He immediately came under fire and had to bring up his shield. The Aqua GM was a fair distance away. Aerum quickly forced his suit down, and aimed carefully around the shield before firing off a few bursts at the Aqua.  The first burst went wide, while the second burst splattered across the Aqua's legs.  Acting quickly Aerum forced his suit to stand and charged towards the immobilized Aqua. 
<br><br>
Hirsch had been having a bad day. First off he hadn't be able to find a water source to use on the designated sparring ground. Then he'd been caught off guard by a burst of fire from Jack.  He had quickly retreated back from the tree line. "Hm that reduced my right arm function by 30%." commented Hirsch. The only bit of good news so far was that only his suits right arm had been hit. Just as the Aqua had finished retreating, Hirsch saw the Gm Ground sniper burst through the trees near where he was hit. Hirsch quickly fired off rounds towards the GM. Right as he was about to move Aerum's return fire splashed across his legs. Hirsch scowled as his suit notified him that his legs were disabled. Hirsch tried to hold Aerum off as he charged by firing the remaining ammo in the clip. It all proved ineffective as Aerum deflected most of the damage with his shield. Aerum ended it by firing a burst of rounds into the Aqua's chest.
<br><br>
Tael saw the Aqua go down. He had led his team to ground as soon as they'd reached the island. Since then he'd carefully led them to the edge of this clearing in time to see the battle break out between Aerum and Hirsch.  "Take careful aim to hit the chest." He told his team. He carefully brought up his m163 launcher. He muttered slightly to himself as he depressed the trigger. His rocket and three others chased towards the GM ground sniper. Two missed completely while one impacted hard on the GM's right shoulder, and the other impacted on the back of the left knee.  Tael grinned a little until he saw the suit twist around. "Run!" was all he managed to yell before paint rounds exploded around them. By the time it was over. Tael and his squad were covered in pink.
