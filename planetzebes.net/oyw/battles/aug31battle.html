<br>
With in the EFSF Grand Fleet there were some antsy pilots just itching for some action. Fortunately for the lower ranked pilots they were treated to some veteran combat. Petty Officer 2nd Class Rem Hase and Sublieutenant Arleana Kerrigan were about to enter into a friendly spar to show the new blood how it's done in space. Rem was in his GM II and Arleana was in her GM Command Kai. The two mobile suits floated in space awaiting for someone to make the first move.
<br><br>

<br>
Rem had to fire his thrusters a bit to keep himself level... little did he know That Arleana took it as a sign to begin the battle. She fired a few bursts from her 90mm machine gun at the GM II. Rem panics a bit and hides behind his shield. He then counters by firing a few shots from his beam rifle at the GM Command Kai. 
<br><br>

<br>
The GM II boosted straight towards the GM Command Kai. The GM Command Kai boosts in a half circle ark, while firing its machine gun, at the charging GM II. The GM II tried to do a barrel rolling turning maneuver but it got pelted in the chest with paint balls and the sparring match was over.

"Just what I need!" Aisha Vemunio muttered, as she saw the Zeon Luggun retreat into the distance, no doubt signaling its more capably-armed friends, who were most likely of the mobile suit variety. The beach had appeared deserted, and she had chosen that route, reasoning that the sea patrols would be too far out to see her, and the land patrols too far inland.
<br><br>
"Maybe I'll be lucky, and it will be a patrol composed entirely of Magellans," Vemunio said with a sigh. She was the leader of the African Union, and she had important business to attend to. There was no time to fight a Zeek patrol, and even less time to be stopped by them and answer the invariably long list of answers.
<br><br>
These Zeeks, however, were not in a talking mood. The 3 Goggs hopped out of the water in front of her almost before she could react, spraying her with water, and the mega-particle beams mounted on their chests. They were fairly poorly-aimed, and Aisha easily avoided them. That faint danger sense tingled in the back of her mind, and Aisha turned, ready to fire as another Gogg appeared in the South African jungle, chest thrust out, trying to aim its megaparticle gun.
<br><br>
"Not a chance!" The GMPGT she controlled dove into the air, and the Gogg awkwardly leaned back, trying to get a bead on the leaping Gundam, until it fell helplessly on its back. <i>Gotcha!</i> Her beam rifle flashed, and the Gogg left a nice crater in the jungle/beach transitional area.
<br><br>
She landed lightly, dodging out of the way of another two rounds of megaparticle fire, right into a third. Her GMPGT's armor was strained, and some systems began to flash red on her control panel, but the blast had been indirect, and the damage was not major. Turning to fire one last time at the cluster of Goggs, she smiled in satisfaction as another enemy mobile suit joined its fallen comrade.
<br><br>
She had no time to make her victory complete. Turning the Gundam into the jungle, she broke into an awkward run, crashing through the undergrowth. The Goggs didn't follow, judging discretion to be the better part of valor. Aisha checked her watch. Five minutes, wasted. Oh well - nothing to do but make the best of it.
