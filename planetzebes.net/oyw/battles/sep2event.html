As far as weather conditions went, it wasn’t that bad in the West Antarctic. It was not any more freezing than normal, the winds were relatively calm, and visibility stretched for miles in all directions. There was not much more that the crew assigned to the Medea-class Din could ask for.
<br><br>
Other than a sign of their prey.
<br><br>
They had been chasing a monstrous Zeonic vessel since it entered the South American network. Time and time again they came close but they never managed to ensnare the heavily damaged vessel. It always found a way to escape into the depths. Reports of its last known heading indicated that it was heading for the Antartic, and before long, the cat and mouse game had begun once again.
<br><br>
Gunships bristling with sensors calibrated for revealing their stealthy foe were fanning out in all directions from the Din. They flew low over the frozen drifts and long undisturbed cliff sides. Every now and then an operator stopped to stare at the penguins and various other fauna of the frozen continent. They quickly returned to their work though. It was far too important to mess up. If they succeeded here then what was quite possibly the last of Zeon’s great leviathans would be stricken from the sea. They would be hailed as heroes and…
<br><br>
“Contact!”
<br><br>
The voice of the gunship’s operator was excited. She had been eager to discover the wounded beast first and her diligent efforts paid off. Her fingers worked quickly to relay data to the other gunships who were swarming towards her own vessel for the kill.
<br><br>
It wasn’t to be though. An object streaked out of the water directly ahead of the gunship. It flew right past her window, and before she could even blink, an explosion shattered the Din. The Medea shuttered violently as it spastically tried to stay in the air despite the loss of its cockpit and front support.
<br><br>
The operator didn’t cry out. She instead concentrated on directing the remaining gunships to encircle their monstrous opponent. With great speed they cast forth their nets, but their foe still managed to slip into depths despite their cries for revenge.

Gilgamos looked up at the lights in the sky. They weren't the Northern lights; they were the lights of the Federation bombardment. They had expected it, and were hunkered down to avoid taking heavy damage from the persistent Federation artillery, but the ordnance being launched their way still had everyone on edge. It looked like he was going to have time for that drink with Tony after all. He'd asked Alec Irusk, but the man was intent on preparing for the impending battle. The Warmonger was a tough man, and an excellent soldier, but Gilgamos was not certain how to approach him.
<br><br>
Akira Sasaki cursed. The Shutzstaffel's panzergrenadiers were Zeon's elite, but even they would have trouble working in this weather. Her mobile suit was being prepared for cold climate combat - not a proper refit, just a few quick fixes and minor modifications that would ensure that everything worked as it was supposed to, at least appromixately. When the Feddies finally climbed out of their tanks and Big Trays, she would show them the resolve of Zeon.

Vladivostok burned, and Edmund Blackadder and Thierry Mersault were enjoying the show of warmth, even if they were far too far away to appreciate it. The chilly night air sucked the warmth from the air like a vaccuum, it seemed, and they sought the shelter of the space heateres once again, debating how many Zeeks would be left after today's thorough shelling. Aaron McCaskey told them to inspect their mobile suits, and they headed out, grumbling, into the chilly hangar, wondering whether it would be them or their mobile suits that froze solid first.
<br><br>
Vladivostok burned, but the Zeon fortification was strong, and both sides were preparing themselves for the inevitable sally into the base. On both sides, hearts burned with fire, passionate, or were cold, resolved. In most men, the emotions were mixed, but there were not many soft men yet alive in either side.
