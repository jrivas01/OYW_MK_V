<br>
The Pacific Ocean is calm for the crew of the Hillock-class <i>Wave II</i>.  They had just arrived on station to plug in a gap in the Pacific patrol line.  The atmosphere amongst the crew is tense.  Just the day before their sister ship, the <i>Wave</i> sank under another Zeon incursion.
<br><br>
On the bridge, a seaman called over his supervisor to the communications suite.  Hushed voices are followed by the sound of running feet.  The captain of the <i>Wave II</i> looks away from the bridge windows as the intercom sqawked.
<br><br>
<i>"Bridge, we just got a code one alert from the Dish aircraft!  Three enemy contacts closing in!"</i>
<br><br>
"Chief!  Sound general quarters!" barked the captain as the ship sprang into action.  Safeties are pulled off weapons, water seal hatches are pulled shut, and the wailing of battle klaxons began.
<br><br>
A flight officer waved his guidance batons as the Don Escargot lifts off the small aft deck of the Hillock.  The blast from the engines washed over the ship as the ASW aircraft swung away from the ship.
<br><br>
Off towards the horizon, a lone Dish aircraft loiters as it spies on the three Zeon units below.  The wakes their thermonuclear hoverjets made in the water can be seen from this height.
<br><br>
"Do we have any more unit in interception range?" one of the Dish operators asked.
<br><br>
Someone spoke up from the other side of the cabin," The 11th Antisub Wing is within margins!"
<br><br>
"Alright, link up with their Dish and let's close in on the intruders."
<br><br>

<br>
Lieutenant Aldo P. Armistad rubs his jaw as his advance unit of the 433rd Basterds soar over the wavetops with ease.  The memories of the Zeon effort to destroy the Trojan Horse.  Their battle with the GM S Type didn't go as expected, but they heard in the after action report that the GM S Type was destroyed.
<br><br>
Armistad's daydream was cut short when his missile alarm went off.  The three Dom pilots woke up from their monotonous blue journey as they split off to evade.  Missiles threw tons of water everywhere as the nimble Doms prepared for combat.
<br><br>
"Donny! Hugo!" shouted Armistad," did you see where this bandit raid came from?!"
<br><br>
"To the west!," replied Donny just as Hugo's Dom pointed to the sky.
<br><br>
From the sky came the 11th Anti-Submarine Wing.  Their pilots cringed at the sight of combat mobile suits.  They are an anti-vessel unit not an air-to-ground unit.  Still, they aimed their 50mm cannons which belched fire at the Doms.  The single Don Escargot from the Hillock came from a separate direction, its weapons blazing as well.
<br><br>
Under the volley of projectiles, Armistad pulled out his MMP-80 90mm machinegun and doubled a Don Escargot's weight as it tried to strafed him.  The ASW plane blew up in a massive fireball.  Around him, Donny and Hugo are taking more careful shots with their 360mm Giant Bazooka.
<br><br>
Suddenly, two giant fountains of water straddled Armistad.  The battle had gotten too close to the <i>Wave II</i> for the Hillock to use its missiles.  The ship fired its fore and aft 130mm cannons as it presented its broadsides to Armistad's mobile suit.
<br><br>
The shell came whizzing by as the leader of the 433rd Basterds lifted his beam bazooka.  Armistad strafed side to side as he waited for the weapons to charge.
<br><br>
After a long twenty seconds, the weapons capacitors are ready.  The beam vaporized water as it passed over the ocean, striking the Hillock amidships.  The Federal warship crumbled like a ball of tin foil before exploding.
<br><br>
But even in death, the <i>Wave II</i> left a parting gift.  Even as the ship was struck by the beam, the 130mm cannons kept firing.  One of the last volley struck the Dom S in the right shoulder, blowing off the mobile suit's arm and sending the beam bazooka flying.
<br><br>
The Dom S itself went careening across the water before it splashed hard.  Armistad worried that he may sink too deep before he regained control.  Suddenly, something caught him.  His Dom S came back to the surface as Hugo's Dom heaved him, thermonuclear hoverjets at maximum setting.  Coming close to help is Donny, clutching  Armistad's beam bazooka.

<br>
Blah blah blah so I'm having a really shitty day and maybe I'll write this later when I don't feel like shit. Till then we're gonna have a comic relief event.
<br><br>
Chan sent in this overcomplicated battle strategy and like all the PCs got scared and left both fleets in question but I mean really?
<br><br>
Come on people. First off, yeah Johnny Ridden has like 250 VP but he's in a fucking Zaku. At Lourm those guys had bazookas firing nuclear warheads that could one hit KO a Magellan. January 0079 is a little different from October, in October I doubt Ridden could solo a Magellan if his life depended on it. Salamis sure, Salamis's have weaker armor and exposed reactors or whatever. But a Magellan? No.
<br><br>
And seriously Chan. Overcomplicated plan for getting the Gwazine back. You're fighting four Magellans, a Gwazine, and a Salamis. Do you really think that anything other than the 250 VP NPC Character is going to get even within firing range of the Ohm fleet. No, it's not. In fact, the only sensible strategy for the resupply fleet is to run the fuck away as fast as it possibly can.
<br><br>
So here's what happens.
<br><br>
Ridden sets off BY HIMSELF to occupy the Ohm fleet while the supply ships make a run for it and the Penguin and Lucifers Fury basically maneuver themselves to be shields for the extremely important supply ships since that fleet is the only thing keeping the war effort alive for Zeon, canonically. I know we have this complicated Side RP mechanism but story-wise those Papuas are the most VIP targets in the entire Zeon military that's why the best pilot in the entire game is defending them.
<br><br>
Ridden zips around a Magellan like magic and shoots out the bridge, but that doesn't destroy the ship cuz' he doesn't have nukes. Then he blows up some of the turrets and flies back. Meanwhile, the Ohm fleet shoots up one of the Papuas. The Lucifers Fury and Penguin are both heavily damaged, and the unlucky Magellan is disabled, and the EF splits the Papuas 500 credit RP between Latooni who didn't leave, and Bosque. The end.
<br><br>
Next time don't be such pussies you guys could have all gotten a couple free VP if you hadn't left the fleets. Now to spend like ten minutes figuring out who DIDN'T leave so I know who to give VP to.
