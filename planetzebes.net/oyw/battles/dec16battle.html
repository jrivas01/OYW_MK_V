A lone GMPGT kneeled in the West Artics. It's shield was rammed into the ground in front of it. A 180 mm artillery cannon was draped over it.Jack Verse rubbed his hands together trying to bring some warmth to them. He gave a small sigh when his hands didn't warm up all that much. Deciding to be a bit more proactive he clicked a few buttons having his suit scan the surroundings again. Moments passed with no report of anything and Jack was beginning to wonder if he shouldn't try another area. A small beep from the console changed his mind though. 
<br><br>
"Lets see what we've got." he said as he leaned forward. He adjusted his screen and 3 mobile suits on what appeared to be dodais. "Hmm looks to be extreme range but lets try it." Said Jack. He shifted the controls and the cannon angled up before the entire suit shifted as the cannon fired.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Rhett clenched his controls tightly as his suit began shaking a little. He hated flying like this and would much rather have his feet on the ground. But sadly he didn't have the luxury of time right now. Thankfully the new Dodai pilot that had transferred to his squad was proving to be a decent pilot. Rhett considered checking in with him but his thoughts were interupted as two cannon shells flashed by his suit. 
<br><br>
"What the hell!" yelled Rhett and the dodai began taking slight evasive actions. He forced his hands to stay steady and swung his suit around slightly trying to spot his attacker. He struggled with his suit trying to steady his aim on the bucking aircraft.  He eventually managed to wrestle his sights on to what looked like a Federation ms. "Lets see how he likes this." Rhett said before he fired off a few shots.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Jack clenched his controls tighter as he saw his first shots miss. As he tried to correct the area around him exploded with shell fire. "Damn, thats one hell of a pilot." Jack said as his suit emerged only lightly damaged from the smoke. 
<br><br>
"Try this." Said Jack firing off a final barrage.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
"Close, but thats enough I think." said Rhett, and he ordered his team to gain altitude. However before his team could react more rounds tore around his suit and one impacted hard into his dodai. "Damn it." Rhett yelled as the dodai seemed to stutter in mid air before exploding. Rhetts suit was thrown by the blast and began falling fast towards the on rushing ground. "Come on!" he yelled and pushed his suits boosters in time to lessen his suits impact into the ground. The rest of his team dove in to check on him and provide cover should further attacks come.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
"Not bad." Said Jack. He pushed his suit to its feet and picked up the shield. "Not bad at all." he said before he began pulling out of the area.

The winds howl with a pitch not found anywhere else in the world.  Snow stuck to everything.  The cold seeps everywhere, even the supposedly heated cockpit of Private Jane Sheppard's GM S-Type.
<br><br>
But it isn't the cold of the West Arctic that caused her to shiver under her pilot suit.  The nightmares are still clinging to the back of her mind. Sheppard has yet to sort them out but her skin shivers nevertheless.
<br><br>
A metallic clanging works its way through the GM S-Type.  At her feet, Ela's Dracken-E waves up at her.  "<i>You okay up there Jane?  You've been zoning out like that for the last few days.</i>"
<br><br>
Sheppard clears her throat before toggling her microphone.  "Yes, Ela I'm fine.  How are you holding up?"
<br><br>
The GM S-Type pilot can see the woman wave from the Dracken-E's controls in the exposed cockpit.  Ela is probably having the worst experience out of all of them.
<br><br>
"<i>I wish I was inside with some hot chocolate</i>," she admits," <i>I can't see anything out here and your Type 74 can't hear anything either.</i>"
<br><br>
"Don't worry Ela, we'll find him sooner or later."
<br><br>

<br><br>
They found him not by a sensor contact or even the distinct footsteps of a mobile suit.  Rather, they found Sergeant Martin Steiner's Dom by the snow being thrown up from his thermonuclear hoverjet engines.  He is getting the hang of his new mobile suit.  The Dom reacts differently from his old Gouf and Steiner remembers the stinging remarks of his mechanic during his first time boarding the new mobile suit.
<br><br>
But now he is adept enough to cruise around with ease.  This is alot more effecient than the brisk run his old Gouf used to do.
<br><br>
Then, out from the white sheet of snow blowing all around him, a hail of 100mm rounds clips him.
<br><br>
As Jane Sheppard broke from cover, she pours the ammunition onto the huge dark form in front of her.  Steiner's grip tightens on his controls as he tries to wrestle the unfamiliar mobile suit.  The combination of bad weather and enemy fire nearly trips his Dom but by some miracle, he draws his heat saber.
<br><br>
For all of the good it did to him.  The GM S-Type leaps at him with beam saber outstretch.  Jane Sheppard knows her mobile suit as if it was another limb.  A bright arc of light severs the Dom's left arm as the heat saber rolls away harmlessly.
<br><br>
The Type 74 and Dracken-E can only listen to the sounds of combat since visibility was so low that they can barely see directly in front of them.  One wrong move and a mobile suit, friend or foe, may accidently step on them.
<br><br>
Sheppard smiled as she saw the Dom's arm detach.  She was about to perform the coup de grace when something hit her GM S-Type hard.  Steiner clenches his teeth as he bludgeons the GM S-Type with the 360mm Giant Bazooka again.  There's no telling how much damage his desperate attack has done to the weapon, so Steiner did the last trick up his sleeve.
<br><br>
Sheppard clutches her eyes as her monitors flare as though she was staring into the sun itself.  She felt something knock her GM S-Type over but her eyes hurt so much that she couldn't control her mobile suit.  The Federal unit lands on its back in the snow.
<br><br>
Half an hour later, a familar sight appears over Jane Sheppard as Ela opens the GM S-Type's cockpit.  The effects of the blinding attack from the Dom's scattering beam gun have finally worn off and Sheppard can see clearly again.  There is no sign of Martin Steiner but the Dom's left arm that he left behind.
