The Tannhauser was crew was in awe as they looked out the bridge of the Chivvay, it was one of the most awesome views possible from space as the sun was being eclipsed perfectly by the sun. Knowing it would only last a short time as their fleet would soon continue in their orbit out of the view of the eclipse the entire crew took their time to witness this event. 
<br><br> 
"I heard about this as a kid, but I never thought it would be this pretty," said a Zeon soldier on the bridge as they all gazed out. It brought a moment of peace for the soldier's that gave them something other then war to think about for this fleeting moment. 
<br><br> 
Even Major General Bomer was caught up in its beauty and smiled as only a few beads of light leaked around the edges of the earth.  
<br><br> 
<i>I haven't seen one of these since I was a kid,</i> thought the Major General as he let even his hardened personality pass as he drifted back to his childhood.

The solar eclipse was distracting for even for Rachel as she gazed over her shoulder occasionaly as she drifted behind a large chunk of debris left over from a colony destroyed during the Lourm campaign. The orbit path would make her come within range of the Bomer's fleet within a couple minutes and the she knew know was the time to deploy her balls. They shook the GM Juggler slightly as they released from their straps on the shoulders of the suit, strangly echoing a sound similar to a cocking a pistol that resonated through the suit. 
<br><br> 
"Well here goes nothing," muttered Rachel as she put on her neurohelmet. Reaching forward she turned all other non-critical systems off her suit to decrease the chances of her detection.  
<br><br>  
<i>Come on, I can do this,</i> thought Rachel as she struggled to get the balls moving even in the right direction at first as her thoughts kept getting distracted by the awesome sight of the eclipse that reflected off the broken solar panels passing around her.

<br><br>

<br><br> 
Aboard the Tannhauser, a small buzzer went off distracting only the grizzled Major General. Glancing over his shoulder Bomer made his way quickly to the radar operators desk where he quickly realized what was going on. 
<br><br> 
"God damn it Corporal Evans! Don't abonandon your post," screamed Bomer at the radar operator as he scrambled to gain the attention of the bridge. 
<br><br> 
"Notify the Recon Zakus, I want targeting on the two objects moving across the bow right behind the eclipse," screamed the Major General as the crew began to scurry about attempting to gain a hold on the situation. 
<br><br>

<br><br> 
"Just a little closer," muttered Rachel to herself as she tried to weave both of the balls at the same time between the debris closer to the fleet. It was then that a sensation went up the spine of Rachel as she suddenly she knew that the Chivay was firing a volley of missiles at the Balls. 
<br><br> 
<i>Just need one clear shot,</i> thought Rachel as she tried to quickly aim and fire, at the last minute she fired a volley of beam fire from both of the balls. The shots drifted just past the side of the Tannhauser, not striking their target. The aggressive volley of missiles however from the Chivvay shot out reaching their targets. They struck both of the balls of the GM Juggler, sending a shockwave down the wires leading back to the GM Juggler.  
<br><br> 
Rachel screamed out in pain in the cockpit of the Juggler as the pain of the destruction of the two bits echoed in her mind. Rolling into a ball in her cockpit Rachel drifted off with the rest of the debris past the fleet, her attack unsuccessful.

<br><br> 
"What were two balls doing this far out from the fleet," questioned a private aboard the Tannhauser as everyone remained on guard. 
<br><br> 
"Those didn't quite seem like normal Balls, and it is definitely strange" muttered Bomer as he sat in his chair on the bridge.
