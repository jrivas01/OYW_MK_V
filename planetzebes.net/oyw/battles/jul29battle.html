<br>The MS-18E Kampfer large blue mobile suit, a dedicated fast assault unit developed in the late dayas of the war. It sported an array of giant bazookas, shot guns, and panzer fausts, all in the hands of a unit that could make 2Gs and spin in 1.2 seconds. Its previous owner, Mikhail Kaminsky, was a member of Zeon Special Forces, a task force meant to steal or destroy the Gundam Alex from the neutral Libot colony. He was killed in action. And here it was in the hands of Roslyn O' Hara.
<br><br>
The Zinnia cruised through space, destination: Moon. It was lunch time for the crew, and they did their best to wolf down their rations. Managing a ship is a hard work, and deserves a hearty meal. Today on the menu: Libot meat, libot bread, some unidentifiable Libot fruit and nutri-drinks. Nonetheless, they were glad to be eating. Roslyn drank a nutri-drink from a straw in the Kampfer, eager to learn all she could about her latest acquisition. 
<br><br>
And that is when the Dozle Fleet came into view. Large, in charge, and on a green barge, Admiral Dozle Zabi was everything you could want in a Zeon soldier. A family man. A manly man. Exactly the kind of man the Zinnia did not want to run into on the way to the moon. A few flares launched, causing a disturbance on the ship, as shuttles came into view. A boarding party.
<br><br>
A seregeant marched his group of marines to the bridge, inspired to investigate the captain and her cargo. The bridge made endless excuses, while at the same time radioing Roslyn to the bridge. She left the Kampfer quickly, locking the cargo bay securely before going to the ship's.. mess?
<br><br>
The soldiers at the bridge waited for hours, antsy and starving. The seregeant grew tired, having already blown his stack a few times, waiting for this captain. The men were fatigued and hungry. The evidence of a recently eaten lunch was spread all out around them. They wanted to go back.
<br><br>
And then came in Roslyn O' Hara, escorted by the chefs of the ship - holding a full meal for each boarder. While officially, they were unable to accept any gifts, they were so tired and starved they gobbled it up mouthful by mouthful. The lesser ranks sat on the floor, while the sergeant took a table with Roslyn, and talked to her about her cargo. She said she was just a food service supplier, on her way to restock a restaurant in Von Braun. Keeping the seregant's glass full did much to keep questions. As they had waited so long, and eaten so much, the seregant reasoned that the ship was legit - but fined Roslyn for making him wait so long. She smiled, saying she would pay the fee, and gave the men each a small ration pack to go with them back to their shuttle.
<br><br>
That is how Roslyn, dead Zeon's suit in tow, evaded Dozle Zabi.
