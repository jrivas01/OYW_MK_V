<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>Des Mielle and the Capetown Guard</b></font></center>
<br><br>
Deep in the South African dessert sat a listing post. It was a squat little building surrounded by a few large tents to house mobile suits. This was home to the Capetown Guard and four Zaku J's were currently kneeling around the outpost. They had just returned from a patrol and the four pilots were lounging around outside the outpost. 
<br>
<br><br>
The patrol leader Jacob noticed an aide running out of the building towards him. With a big sigh to himself he stood and met the aide. "Jacob, we think we've detected something near the ruins of RF-4." the Jacob nodded and motioned towards his squad.
<br>
<br><br>
"We'll take a look." he told the aide and ran to his machine, and the four Zaku's moved out.
<br>
<br><br>
Des and his squad were currently hunkered down at the base of a sand dune. They'd just left the ruins of the RF-4 mining base.  Des himself was currently kneeling next to Sergi confirming their location. While the rest of the squad kept a look out.
<br>
<br><br>
"So we're here and we need to get here?" asked Des. Sergi nodded and began rolling the map up. "Des I see Zaku's." called Thomas. Des looked up at Thomas who was standing at the top of the dune. Thomas motioned towards the opposite side of the dune identifying the direction.
<br>
<br><br>
"How many?" Des yelled as he began running up the dune to take a look himself.  "I count four, looks like the J types too." said Thomas a Des reached him.  Quickly grabbing the binoculars Des confirmed it for himself.
<br>
<br><br>
"Everyone get in position for an ambush." Yelled Des as he turned and came halfway down the dune to grab his gear from Sergei. "You sure about this?" Sergei asked. Des nodded, "We don't have much choice. Their too close and if we run they'll see us." replied Des. Nodding his reply Sergei made his way to the top of the dune with Des and primed his rpg.

<br><br>
"It should be just over that dune." Said Jacob as he pushed his patrol forward.  The four Zaku's were currently pushing across the dessert towards the dune Des's squad was hiding at. Just before they reached the dune multiple rpgs shot off it towards him and his patrol.
<br>
<br><br>
The Zaku next to Jacob's reeled from the hits. One impacted directly into it's mono eye. Two impacted directly into the suits right knee, effectively crippling it. However four rpgs impacted directly into the cockpit. The pilot had but a few seconds to scream before his cockpit was torn apart.
<br>
<br><br>
Jacobs cried in anger as he saw a member of his patrol fall. Him and the other two zakus's took superficial damage compared to their fallen member.  Without hesitating they all three opened fire. 120mm rounds punched into the dune before it was blown apart by blasts from a 280 mm bazooka.
<br>
<br><br>
Des opened his eyes to find himself on his back being drug by Sergei."What happened?" was all Des managed to choke out.
<br>
<br><br>
Sergei looked down at him. "We got one of them, but their return fire blew the whole dune apart." Said Sergei. "I'm sorry Des, but Thomas and Somer didn't make it." Sergei confessed with remorse in his voice. 
<br>
<br><br>
Des felt numb at hearing the news and tried to get up. "Easy Des, you got bang up bad when you were thrown off the dune. We'll patch you up back at the mine. Just hang tight." said Sergei. Des relented and let his remaining men carry him back.
