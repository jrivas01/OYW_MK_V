The silence that lingers in the freezing climate of the West Arctic is anything but reassuring to the Federal forces still in the area.  Death came from above two days in a row and for the crew of the Medea-class <i>Mississipi</i>, death feels like it's just a split second away.
<br><br>
Even the usually gung-ho Tin Cod pilots are solemn as they sat in their cockpits.  The ferocity of yesterday's Dopp attack humbled them as they flew around the Medea transport, feeling about as vulnerable as that flying cardboard box.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The Zanzibar-class <i>Shooting Star</i> eased its way through the upper atmosphere.  The bane of Federal forces flew with confidence and pride.  It lead the killing stroke against New Amsterdam and the day after forced the disbandment of the Fedreal 77th Brigade.
<br><br>
Now, as Master Sergeant Rhett Paruta walked onto the bridge of the shooting star, he joins Captain Vina Sealander as she stared out the bridge windows.
<br><br>
"You are walking pretty well," remarked Sealander," for someone with your motion sickness."
<br><br>
"The meds just started working," mumbled Paruta with a new grudge against pharmaceutical companies.
<br><br>
"Good because we found the Medea that got away the other day."
<br><br>
"How long?"
<br><br>
"Any moment now."
<br><br>

<br>
Captain Aaron McCaskey blessed his fortune that the snowstorm last week died off.  The skies are clear enough in this region that he can hit targets with reasonable accuracy and an acceptable distance.  The GM Land Combat Type raised its railcannon as its sensors sweeped the sky.
<br><br>
His moustache twitched as McCaskey's eyes squinted, studying the screen in front of him.  The words of his father came to him as McCaskey concentrated.  The EFGF officer would only have a window of a half a minute at most and he hopes that will be enough.
<br><br>
... There.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
A sleepy mechanic was unwrapping a ration bar when he cast a glance outside the Medea's window.  The ration bar fell from his hands as the mechanic stared waving frankly.
<br><br>
"AAAHH!  AHHHHHHH!" shouted the poor man, momentarily losing the capacity to speak.  He pointed frightenly out the window.  A few of his companions went up to him to find out what was wrong and as soon as they saw what he was pointing at, they rushed to raise the alarm.
<br><br>
The Tin Cods are already moving when the <i>Shooting Star</i> came within firing range.  The AA guns of the Zanzibar began firing, giving the Tin Cods something to worry about for the few seconds left before the <i>Shooting Star</i> can fire.
<br><br>
Suddenly, just as ultimate victory was within their grasp, the <i>Shooting Star</i> rocked to the side.  At that same moment, the mega particle cannons fired, just missing the <i>Mississipi</i> by mere feet.  The beams were so close that metal plating on the airframe boiled and broke off.  A klaxxon begain wailing as Captain Sealander pulled herself up to a standing position.
<br><br>
"Report!" ordered Sealander, believing that's what Rebecca would have done.
<br><br>
"We're being hit by something unknown!  Impacts to our starboard side!"
<br><br>
<i>Damn,</i> though Sealander,<i> at least it's not GM Ground Snipers-</i>
<br><br>
Sealanders eyes widen at the thought.  "Bring us up!" she shouted," evasive manuevers!  We may be flying into a killbox!"
<br><br>
Paruta hung on as he felt the large engines on the Zanzibar built up power.  As they ascended, he watched the shape of the Medea turn smaller and smaller.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
<i>Damnit</i> thought McCaskey with his finger on the trigger,<i> I guess that's it for today.</i>
<br><br>
The Zanzibar is now tiny on his targetting scopes and his onboard computer is not powerful enough to guide the railcannon to hit a target at this range.  Nor does McCaskey have enough rounds to blindly shoot at a flying target.
<br><br>
As both McCaskey and Paruta watched their prey escape, they both shared the same thought:  <i>There is always another day</i>
<br><br>
<center><b>Outcome: Federal Victory</b>
<br>Aaroon McCaskey - 3 VP gained, No Damage
<br>Rhett Paruta - 4/2 VP gained, Fatigued 2
<br>Jim Irvin - 1 VP gained, No Damage

<br>
"Everything is in place Beria..." Laredo wiped his hands together as he entered the bridge of the Lucifer's Fury. The Schuzstaffel agent had done his part, putting all the appropriate pieces in place as the Tivvay and Chivvay began to make their rendevouz with the Dren Fleet. Just a few steps behind Untersharfuhrer Veil, a female Schuzstaffel officer followed. "We are ready for departure." She chimed in.
<br><br>
The wild captain of the Lucifer's Fury looked at the two Schuzstaffel officers with a bit of disdain, but nodded in acknowledgment. Her hair was rather unkept and fell across her face, covering the scar that was where her right eye would have been. She was a hardened officer and at one point would have been considered a prime candidate for the same uniform Laredo Veil wore, but she made it clear she had no desire to join Gihren's ranks. "The we shall be on our way, Commander Dren is expecting us."
<br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Hey, Alex, I think I have a shooting solution..." Michael Kruez mused aloud as his scope registered an enemy Chivvay. He adjusted his sights slightly, and was able to confirm the other two ships. "Confirmed, its the Zeon fleet we were looking for."
<br><br>
Alex Sentara was still in the hangar of the Buster Ichi Go, readying his Saberfish II to engage when he heard over his communications link that the fleet had been sighted. An arrogant smile flashed across his face as he sat in the cockpit and brought his fighter online. Today was going to be a good day...
<br><br>
"If you have the shot, take it. Disable their flag ship, and we'll go sweep in for the kill." Alex smirked as the Saberfish was taxied out and lined up for take off. With out hesitation he took off, the small fighter bursting out into the vast void of space, a speck in comparison to the large ships of the Cygnus fleet. Shortly after his launch several other older model saberfish took to the battle field. 
<br><br>
"Roger that." Michael moved his sights to the Tivvay class ship, a smile curling across his lips as his targeting computer began to flash red. "Gotchya!" His smile spread into a full on grin as he squeezed the trigger, sending a bright pink lance of energy hurtling across the emptiness of space. The shot landed right on target, piercing the Lucifer's Fury right through the main engine. The GM Sniper propped itself up on the bow of the Sulafat Carrier, pulling the rifle up as he zoomed in with the GM's optical cameras. 
<br><br>
"Uh, Kruez... you might want to look at your target..." Derek Carter radioed the sniper as the Guncannon pilot saw the Tivvay begin to implode, and almost 'shrivel' in on itself. The sniper hung his head in shame as he watched the image on his monitors. The shot had landed true, but the target was nothing more than a decoy. upon regaining his composure, he leveled his rifle once more towards the fleet and scanned them over once more. "Yeah... Neither of the other ships budged..."
<br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Don't move..." an SS Officer growled as the Jicco Captain flinched, wanting to go with his instinct and run. The remaining skeleton crew had seen the beam shot pierce the balloon decoy, and began to sweat as they feared they were next. Three pilots climbed into their Zaku II's as they prepared to cover the Jicco's retreat. "... You have your part to play, Untersharfuhrer Veil and Commander Beria made that clear, we are to cover their escape."
<br><br>
The Captain seemed to swallow his tongue as he watched a squad of Saberfish and a Guncannon make its way towards their location. 
<br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Alex, it looks like its nothing but a decoy fleet. There's no movement, its dead..." The sniper shouldered his rifle and boosted off the deck of the Columbus Carrier, following the Fighter squad towards the fleet to investigate further. Alex couldn't help but laugh at the irony of the decoy fleet, but at the same time was rather disappointed that he would not get to boast an actual victory over the Zeon military this day. As he let his guard down, his proximity alarms began to sound, and his cockpit began flashing red. "What the hell is this?!"
<br><br>
Three Zakus appeared from behind the two ships, their thrusters blasting at full capacity as they sped towards the oncoming fighters. As Sentara and the saberfish scattered, the Jicco finally came to life, its thrusters glowing as they came to life and began to move. 
<br><br>
"Shit, its a trap!" Derek brought his cannons forward and aimed on the mobilized gunboat. At the same time Michael Kruez brought his suit to an abrupt stop and positioned his rifle to try and make a shot. As his scope focused in on the ship, his monitor was filled with a display of missiles as it fired its whole compliment in attempt to escape. Missiles rammed into Saberfish left and right, only a few skilled enough to weave in and out of the erratic fire. 
<br><br>
Alex chuckled as he deftly rolled his way around the missiles, a few trusting souls following him as he continued evasive manuevers. He couldn't help but laugh at the turn of events, thinking he may have preferred the lack of action to being caught with his pants down. Dodging the last missile he banked left and brought his sights on one of the Zaku's, pulling the trigger, his missiles rocketed towards the suit, exploding on impact. He began to smile as he looked for another target, only to be clipped on the wing by a stream of machine gun fire. "Sonuva..."
<br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Steady..." Michael sat at the edge of the battle field, alone, as he trained his gun on the Jicco as it kicked its thrusters into full and tried to exit the area. "I don't think so..." He squeeze the trigger, and again his barrel buzzed to life as it expelled a bright pink blast of energy that pierced through all the chaos on the battle field, missing everything but his target. The shot hit one of the three fuel tanks, sending the Jicco up in a flash; the explosion knocked the remaining Zaku's off balance, allowing Derek to take them out with two shots. 
<br><br>
The remaining Saberfish made a run at the last 'ship' spraying it with their vulcans. The small rounds punctured the remaining balloon and the squad turned around and headed back for the ship; their fuel was running low anyways...
<br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Good to see you Commander Dren." Beria saluted her fellow Officer as she boarded the Camel, Musai Class ship. Flanked by the two Schuzstaffel officers she handed over her orders and shook Dren's hand. 
<br><br>
"Good to have you with us Commander Beria..."

<br>
"Well boys, thank you for the tour, but I really must be going."
<br><br>
He heard and felt the soft push of a wooden rifle butt hitting his back, forcing him to move forward.
<br><br>
"Less talkin' more walkin' ya damn Zeek spy."
<br><br>
"Now now, no need to be so harsh."
<br><br>
He was pushed towards something, felt like a wooden pole. The two men strung him up on it, tying his hands behind it to prevent his escape. It was only after this that they took the blindfold off. He was in a local village, with simple poor huts, straw roofs, rice paddies as far as the eye could see. Hans surmised that the forest must be behind him. The two thugs walked back to the crowd, AK-47's on their shoulders. Another man came and threw dry kindling onto the bonfire at Hans' feet. As more kindling was piled, a large, bald, crippled man was wheeled out to look at his captive. He was clearly the leader of the group.
<br><br>
"Sir, I'm afread you're misrepresenting your customs. People aren't burned alive in Thailand, you're thinking of India. And last I checked, I was not a widow." Hans said to the guerrilla leader, who laughed aloud.
<br><br>
"We have a funny man here." He snickered. A short, redheaded girl walked up behind the man. She was wearing a hodgepodge of Federation military gear and jungle camouflage, her hair done back by a tight green bandana. She wrapped her arms around the crippled man and stared at Hans, grinning.
<br><br>
"You see, you and your bastard kind came from space, so we figure we'll just send you back there." The leader chuckled. He snapped his fingers, and one of the thugs came out from the crowd, carrying a torch.
<br><br>
"Well you know, I always enjoy a smoke before takeoff, could you indulge me?" Hans asked, leaning his chin and motioning towards his jacket pocket. The thug with the torch looked at the crippled leader, who shrugged and nodded. The man took the pack of cigarettes out of Hans pocket, smacked one into his hand, and then put it in his mouth. The thug then deposited the pack in his own pocket, lit the bonfire, and began to walk away.
<br><br>
"Much obliged." Hans said with a curt nod. The leader of the Thai guerrillas chuckled again.
<br><br>
"Before we kill you and send you back to your nazi kin, I'd like to know your name, funny man." He smiled a wide smile, Kiki watching Hans with an equally menacing look.
<br><br>
"The name is Bond. Hans Bond."
<br><br>
Hans bit down on the cigarette, and the pack exploded in the thugs pocket, releasing a compacted weapons grade smokescreen. There was firing moments later, but Hans had broken free of his bonds during the conversation and hid behind the wooden pole. The moment the firing stopped Hans rushed forward, grabbing a pistol off of the crippled mans belt. Taking ahold of Kiki by the neck, Bond levelled the gun at her temple and slowly walked back towards the rice patties. The smoke settled, revealing four dozen or more armed civilians aiming straight at the operative.
<br><br>
"Now now, lets not heat up this situation more than we already have." Hans said, slowly backing into the rice patties. He looked at Kiki.
<br><br>
"I'm sorry dear, I have a captivating personality."
<br><br>
Kiki howled, and in the same moment Bond pushed her towards the thugs, ducking into the thickness of the patties and rushing off towards the forest. The guerrillas ran after him, Kiki moving back behind them and shaking off a cold sweat.
<br><br>
If he moved fast, he would still make it to the target on time. 
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The U-77 Lorelay sailed silently through the water, just below surface level. There hadn't been many Federation patrols in the region, and chatter was more or less silent. Hans had been sent out solo hours before.
<br><br>
"Maam, we are in position." The Helmsman of the Lorelay looked back over his shoulder and saluted Marina. She was standing as tall as she could, barely over the railing of her vantage point on the bridge, her oversized hat cocked and covering one eye.
<br><br>
"Good. Put me through with commander Brennan."
<br><br>
"Aye Maam." The crew swiftly went to work, not wasting a single moment. One of the screens in the fore of the bridge flicked on, showing Xavier in his normal suit. He gave Marina a kurt salute.
<br><br>
"Sir, our bombardment trajectory has been analyzed. We are ready to begin the operation."
<br><br>
Xavier smiled, giving a gentle nod. He flipped the monitor off, not wishing to show any more emotion than he had earlier in the day. For once he was pleased with the operation, there was no risk of Marina.. No risk of the Lorelay getting hurt. The rear launch tubes of the Jukon opened up, Xaviers Z'Gok moving towards one of Cambodias many rivers, flanked by a pair of Acquy's.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Hell no I ain't carryin' none o' you creepy black KKK around in my machine." Hugo spat at Ritter, moving quickly to his Dom to prevent reprisal.
<br><br>
"There have been heavy rains recently, my second squad has not been outfitted with the proper gear. They require an alternate means of transport." Ritter remained emotionless, looking like a robot in the black suit. Normally he would have killed the man, but Aldo had some special clout with lady Kycillia, and outranked him. A pity.
<br><br>
"And I don't give two shits, I am not yer 'alternate means of transport'." Hugo turned around, giving a loud harumph and climbing into his Dom. Donny whistled loudly as he walked past, his prized slugger resting comfortably on his shoulder. Aldo moved behind Ritter, patting him on the shoulder while he became intimate with the local brand of smoke.
<br><br>
"Don't fret none mister Novosad, we've got more than enough troops for this operation, lets save our anger for those poorly bred Earthers." Armistad patted the Panzergrenadiers shoulder again, walking towards his own Dom.
<br><br>
"... Indeed." Ritter responded. If it was possible behind his mask, you could see his eyes narrow.
<br><br>
Elsewhere in the Virgils hangar, Rose Adeline and Rhin Belicoff were getting into their mobile suits, the cold hearted SS vixen and the somewhat less coldhearted TAF babe preparing for combat.
<br><br>
"Oh come on, I only asked if he was married. It's an innocent question~" Rhin snickered, sensing the anger in Rose's lack of a reply.
<br><br>
"Focus on the mission Rhin, there's supposed to be an ace team on this base." Rose finally responded. One day she would become tired of Rhin, and then things would all work out just fine. <i>One day.</i>
<br><br>
In the bay next to them, Finus was already prepared for combat. He hadn't quite fit in with the rest of the crew yet. He was one of the youngest, and one of the least experienced in the fleet. However, his skill had allowed him to rise in rank rather quickly, and he hoped he could prove himself worthy to fight alongside heroes such as Xavier and Aldo. Climbing onto his Dodai II, Finus's Gouf Custom blasted off into the jungle below the clearing. The Virgil had set up firing positions several kilometers away from the base, finding high ground that was not disturbed by the recent flooding in the area. Following Finus came Rose and Rhin, then the Basterds, and finally Ritter Novosad and his Panzergrenadiers, maneuvering through the underbrush on their Wappas.
<br><br>
Ghirens Schutzstaffel was on the attack.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Aaand there you go." Shiro smiled, putting his pen back in his pocket. He leaned against the crates and picked up his book, smiling and reading. His thoughts weren't really in the book, they were of that girl he'd met in orbit. What was her name? Aina?
<br><br>
Karen walked away, leaving Shiro. Her paperwork had been signed, and she was off to enjoy a day of drinking in one of the local towns. A well manicured, black haired, German looking man in a Federation uniform that wasn't quite the right size walked past them, giving Michael a V sign. Eledore snuck past behind him, opening a magazine to the camera, showing the centerfold of this months playboy. A blonde.
<br><br>
It was a nice day, a quiet day, and the 08th was off duty for a while. They'd just gotten back from a big operation, having met up with Kojima in India and engaged a sizable Zeonic supply operation. They were tired. Kiki was supposed to be in the village today.
<br><br>
In the background, Jidan stretched his arms, waking up from his nap. He was on one of the roofs of a nearby bunker, covered like most of them were with moss and other earthenworks. The buildings blended in well with the jungle. Jidan was the pilot of the bases Medea, the Maque. He put his somewhat goofy cowboy hat on and climbed off the building, unscrewing the cap to his flask and taking a drink. Shiro was still reading.
<br><br>
A transport truck went by, tracking up dust that smacked Jidan in the face, startling him considerably. Jidan yelled and hollered, shaking a fist as old people do, but the truck driver payed no attention. Then he looked over and saw that Michael was filming Shiro. He pointed and started laughing. Sanders walked over, wondering what all the fuss was about. He didn't quite get it.
<br><br>
A butterfly landed on the lens to the video camera, and Michael tried to bat it away, but by now Shiro had caught on. He scowled at Michael and threw his book at the camera, getting up while the tripod fell to the ground with a whud. The butterfly flew into the sky, and then fluttered offscreen. It was a nice day, with clear skies. Clear enough to see the missile contrails flying in from the coast...
<br><br>
"Holy shit holy shit we're all gonna die! I'll never see my true love again~" Michael yelled, his voice cracking with prepubescence. The missiles detonated overhead, but their payload seemed invisible. Michael noted a distinct lack of explosives.
<br><br>
"W-were they duds..." He asked himself. Was he imagining it? He was then picked up by the shirt collar, Karen pushing him towards the hangar.
<br><br>
"Minovsky particle rounds, there'll be an attack any minute now." She answered. Sanders, Shiro and Eledore were already running to their machines, Jidan moving quickly towards the Maque.
<br><br>
"Get everything in the air, prep the Maque for takeoff. With that many warheads there must be an entire fleet firing on us." A flight controller yelled. Tin Cod pilots scrambled to get their birds airborne, while tank drivers revved up their machines. Luckily, Southeast Asia HQ was built on a small hill, and the recent flooding hadn't quite made it to the bases gates.
<br><br>
Shiro leapt into his Gundam, firing up its systems and turning on the radio. The static was already almost unbearable, but the particles hadn't made it inside the hangar itself yet.
<br><br>
"Eledore, I need a situation report."
<br><br>
Eledore slid into his chair at the back of the Type 74, something of an office that was surrounded by all manner of pornography. He pressed his headset to one ear, holding a hand up to stop Michaels yammering for a few seconds.
<br><br>
"Skirts and carpet riders, coming in from the south. Looks like about half a dozen. Nothing coming in from the north, it's an amphibious assault."
<br><br>
"Roger that. The 8th team will take point, 7th team, you boys cover us." Shiro said, moving his Gundam out towards the bases southern perimeter. Karen and Sanders flanked him, with Ground type GMs bringing up the rear.
<br><br>
About a kilometer to the south, the Basterds were having a little bit of trouble with the terrain, the thick jungle preventing them from moving at full speed.
<br><br>
"Wish this colony had a gardner worth a shit." Donny laughed, pushing trees aside and moving his Dom forwards. "You think there's anything we can do about this?"
<br><br>
Aldo smirked, starting the charger on his beam bazooka. "Yeah, I guess a little street cleanin's in order."
<br><br>
Missiles and artillery shells started to rain down on the compound, with an eerie amount of accuracy. The Elliot powered up its main guns, taking aim at the Dobday, which had revealed itself in the distance. The two started a battle of artillery, one that the Dobday was much better suited to. A warhead from the Lorelay smashed down on the Maques left wing, obliterating it and grounding the craft. Jidan sighed, taking another swig of his flask and leaning back.
<br><br>
"Better scrap the thing while there's still time, I guess." He sighed.
<br><br>
"I can't tell which way they're coming, they're moving so slow." Eledore yelled, trying to listen to his instruments and give instructions to Shiro at the same time. Shiro looked around, watching for any sign that the enemy MS were in a specific area. Trees rustling, birds flying away, anything...
<br><br>
All of a sudden there was a bright flash of light, a huge mega particle burst cutting down hundreds of trees and lurching straight past the far side of the compound. Moments later a trio of Doms shot through the new pathway, blazing at full speed and firing their bazookas. The 08th shifted position, raising shields and returning fire with their machineguns.
<br><br>
"Catch me if y'can." Hugo laughed, skating through the base and firing as he went. The two teams couldn't severely damage each other, the Doms speed and the GMPGTs armor preventing most of the damage on either side.
<br><br>
Overhead, Dopps and Tin Cods collided, the battle for the air fierce and without an immediate victor. The Dopps better designs gave them an edge, but the Federation fighters outnumbered them, and were assisted by antiaircraft turrets on the ground. AA gunners blazed away, preventing the Dopps from using their superior speed to press the advantage. One particular gunner was about to shoot down an enemy fighter when a man patted him on the shoulder.
<br><br>
"Care for a nap old boy?" Hans asked, punching the gunner in the face. He quickly grabbed the antiaircraft gun, swivveled it around and began firing it into the Elliots bridge glass. Without their CiC team coordinating fire, the Elliot lost a lot of its effectiveness. It was subdued by bombardment from the Virgil and Marinas fleet shortly thereafter. The Elliots Sniper leapt off the Tray, grabbing a machinegun and joining the beleagered forces on the ground.
<br><br>
Rhin and Rose leapt off their Dodais and smacked into the 7th MST, machineguns blazing and heat swords white with anticipation. The GM Ground pilots pulled back, doing their best to create a suppressive barrage and knock the Goufs back. Type 61's rolled in between the mobile suits, adding to the firepower. For the moment, Rose and Rhin were checked.
<br><br>
"Where's the rest of the damn fleet.." Rose asked angrily. In response, a group of Zakus leapt down onto the base, accompanied by a wing of Gunship Helis. The lot of them began firing on Federal positions, destroying tanks and pushing the GM Grounds back. Finus emerged out of the undergrowth, pouring on fire with his gatling and destroying several of the tanks.
<br><br>
"Hit them Rhin!" Rose yelled, charging forward. She threw her heat rod forward, slicing a tank in two while Rhin got in the middle of the GMs, cutting one apart effortlessly. Rose was about to total a second GM when she felt a tingling sensation in the back of her head. She pulled her Gouf back, a mega particle beam slicing out in front of her. Turning her Gouf, she barely stopped the Gundams punch with her shield, her Gouf taking several steps back to stabilize itself.
<br><br>
"Pick on somebody your own size bitch!" Karen yelled, dropping her beam rifle and grabbing a saber.
<br><br>
Below the treeline, Wappas shot out of the undergrowth, Ritter and his men using the confusion to make it deep into the compound. His orders were to capture the Elliot, but it was already a smoking wreck, and he had other ideas in mind. He leapt off the Wappa, letting it go careening out of control into the bases medical tent, ignoring the red cross atop the structure.
<br><br>
"Kill everyone." He yelled coldly, aiming his machinegun and firing indiscriminately into the base. Marines ducked for cover, firing back as best they could. The base was in chaos, and there was little they could do against Novosad and his crack troops. However, as he fired the trees behind him began to rustle, and dozens of armed civilians started to rush onto the compound.
<br><br>
"I hope Shiro is still alive.." Kiki said, rushing onto the muddy compound. She got down on one knee, aiming and firing a rocket propelled grenade at one of the Gunship Helis. The round hit, the helicopter stuttering in midair and falling to the ground. The guerrillas reinforced the bases Marines, engaging in a deadly firefight with Ritter and his men. A team of Fanfans moved towards Ritter, attempting to assist the ground forces with their missiles. However, a Rogue AA turret trained on their position, Hans downing two before his position became compromised. The third Fanfan fired a rocket towards Bonds gun, Bond leaping out of the way and rolling with the explosion. Ritters team downed the third Fanfan shortly after, allowing them to resume the battle with Kiki's guerrillas.
<br><br>
Shiro and Sanders kept firing on the Basterds, now down to their last magazines. Bazooka shells slammed into their Gundams again, which were starting to show the wear and tear of successive bombardment. Shiro gritted his teeth, dropping his gun and pulling out a beam saber.
<br><br>
"You bastards!! I'm going to live!" He yelled melodramatically, charging towards Aldo and his team. Hugo grabbed his heat saber, moving to meet Shiro head on. Aldo blasted 90mm shells into Eledore and Michaels truck, disabling it while Donny and Sanders faced off.
<br><br>
Rhin, Finus and Rose were having considerably less trouble. Now in a continued melee with the Federation suits, they had carved through three GM Grounds, and were now on the last Federation tanks and mobile suits. Rose was in a protracted duel with Karen, who proved to be much tougher than she looked. Despite Roses advantage in skill, the Gundam was simply stronger and faster than her Gouf. The two exchanged blows, locking sabers and then pushing away.
<br><br>
"Gah.." Rose grimaced, pushing forwards again. She slammed her shield into the side of Karens Gundam, which took several lumbering steps backwards, and towards Finus and Rhin. Finus swerved around, slicing out with his sword and cutting off the left leg of Karens unit. The Gundam smashed into the earth, defeated.
<br><br>
Around the same time, Xavier and the Acquy's emerged from the bases north end, firing MPCs and missiles into the Federal positions. Ritter and his men used the new confusion to break the enemy infantry positions, rushing onto the base. He moved from bunker to bunker, turning a corner and coming face to face with a Federal soldier. The two instinctively raised their weapons, then lowered them and shook hands.
<br><br>
"Hope I left enough for you." Hans smiled, turning and moving with Ritter and his men. Xavier rushed into the middle of the compound, blasting MPCs into Sanders Gundam and disabling it. The base was all but captured at this point.
<br><br>
Hugo and Shiro's mobile suits slid past each other, swinging their sabers and coming to a mutual halt. Aldo moved up behind Shiro's Gundam, blasting the remains of his magazine into the Gundams legs and causing it to topple over.
<br><br>
"We got 'em. Donny, Hugo, good work." Armistad smiled. The Federation had been thoroughly and completely raped.
<br><br>
"Thanks boss. Looks like we get to do a little tee off tonight too." Donny snickered, watching as the remainder of the bases crew and mobile suit pilots surrendered and were pushed into a clump amidst the destruction. "Ain't that right Hugo?"
<br><br>
But Hugo didn't answer. A moment later the Dom exploded, Aldo watching with his jaw wide, the remains of his cigar dropping onto the metal floor of his cockpit. Hugo was dead.
<br><br>
Armistads eyes narrowed, watching as the young, dark haired Federation officer was pushed out of his fallen Gundam and corraled towards the other captives.
<br><br>
He would pay.
