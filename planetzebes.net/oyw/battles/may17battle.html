<br>
Within the fields of Europe, two comrades of the 87 Intergrated fleet stare at each other. One of them being Cray Vermillion in his Type 61 Tank and the other being Jarvis Ackart. Tank vs Gum Command was the theme of this spar today and an angry Ion once again yells. 
<br><br>
<center><font color=”3300FF” size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
"Now were fighting a DAMN GM COMMAND! WHATS WRONG WITH YOU!" Cray sighed before responding back to Ion, "At least its sunny out so SHUT THE HELL UP!" 
<br><br>
Jarvis made his way in with his GM Command, armed with only his head vulcans. He had left his beam sabers behind as it would have been overkill to have them. As he approached the Type 61, the GM command fired a burst of head vulcan ammo in the past of the Type 61. Cray and Ion both stopped shouting at each other as they felt the virbration of the ammo against the ground. 
<br><br>
<center><font color=”3300FF” size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
"WHAT IN THE HELL WAS THAT!" Shouted Ion. Cray turned his attention to the radar and fired the Type 61's cannon.
<br><br>
Jarvis manuvered his GM command Out of the way but not before the paint round grazed the side of the right arm of the GM Command. Jarvis gritted his teeth and fired another burst of vulcan head ammo at the tank. The tank rocked to the side this time, as Cray and Ion both cursed they got it barely back under control and fired another paint shell.
<br><br>
<center><font color=”3300FF” size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
Jarvis 's GM Command's head was hit with the paint round splattering pink paint all over the visor. "Damnit..." Jarvis said quietly as he was stairing at a now pink screen. He gave up not expecting to have gotten pinked all over his face from a tank.
<br><br>
"HA! LOOKS LIKE WE WON!" Cray shouted out in the cockpit of the type 61. He had a smug look on his face. Unknowing to him that in his smugness they drove over the foot of the GM command and tipped over.
<br><br>
"YOU AND YOUR GOD DAMNED CRAZY SPARRINGS!" Ion shouted out as the tank was flipped on its top and the two tankers started shouting at each other again.
