<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>Skeggold, the Ice Cream Truck, taking on the Green Lobsters!</b></font></center>
<br>
The mighty African Union fleet of Skeggold trucks ever onwards down the South-western African coastline, dreams of African liberation riding along in the heavy trucks and their Federation built Big Trays.
<br><br>
Doctor Kuuro Konishi watched the horizon, his Xamel mobile suit trailing the <i>Ice Cream Truck</i> as it moved along with the fleet, blaring "Pop Goes the Weasel", as ice cream trucks are wont to do. His eyes moved with a surgical precision, as he picked out something in the distance, coming from the shoreline.
<br><br>
The Green Lobsters, the famed Gogg squadron of the South African waters had spotted the African Union trucks when they had passed through their sensor range. The African Union had been in a thorn in the side of the Principality since near the beginning of the war, and the eager squadron had been looking to even the score, maybe even make a larger name for themselves, to match the Red Dolphins team. The lead Gogg pilot smiled as the four portly mobile suits moved out from the sea, firing their mega particle cannons as soon as a firing solution was achieved.
<br><br>
Malak Lazarevich's GM Sniper II shook as the desert sands around him burst apart, some turning to glass from the impact from the mega particle cannon. The trucks of the AU fleet began to disperse, almost in a classic "circle the wagons" procedure. Meanwhile, the Big Trays launched their Type 61s and mobile suit contigents, while Malak and Kuuro positioned themselves in an optimal sniping position.
<br><br>
The mega particle blasts of the Goggs continued, diminishing in power with each blast as the Goggs started moving out from their favored terrain onto the shore itself. Malak kept his eyes on the lead Gogg, lining up his sights on the sniper rifle, until the shot was perfect. Unfortunately, that meant a lot of standing still, which allowed the Goggs to get a lucky shot on him, blowing the leg out from underneath his GM Sniper, but not before he pressed the trigger on the long range beam rifle. The beam cut through two Goggs, sending them exploding into the sand below them.
<br><br>
Kuuro was a bit more mobile in his Xamel, the thermonuclear propulsion units in its "legs" keeping it moving as he readied the long range missile launchers. His MS team worked on providng covering fire with their shell firing weapons, until the contrails of missiles burst into the air, arcing over the AU fleet, and finally hitting their mark on the Goggs. The maneuver had cost him, though, and he would have to spend time working on getting the sand out of the filters.

<br>Kuuro Konishi: 7 VP gained, Repairing 1+1
<br>Malak Lazarevich: 5/2 VP gained, Repairing +1</center>

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>Paradropping New York</b></font></center>
<br>
In the jungles of South America, lays the Tug, a Meada Revised aircraft. In the aircraft the squads of marines go over their plan for the capture of New York. They believe that the best option is to do the time honored tradition of Para-dropping. The squads prepare their parachutes and combat gear. You hear the clicking of buckles and magazines loading into their guns. The leader of the strike force signals the Meada pilot and it lifts off from the ground and starts to head towards its destination.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The Meada approaches its destination, “Alright Marines gear up and prepare for drop!” The head marine shouts out to his squads. The pilot opens the rear hatch, “Good luck down there” He says as the marines salute and jump out of the Tug. They pull  on there parachutes as they float to the ground. 
<br><br>

<br>
They managed to land behind the enemy's defenses and infiltrate the base. They walk around shooting at anybody not wearing an EF uniform. As they made their way to the command center, they killed the base CO and demanded everybody surrender. The enemy forces surrender and the Zeonic flag was taken down and a Earth Federation arose in its place. The EFGF has done a great service by capturing New York.
<br><br>
<center><b>Outcome: Earth Federation Victory, New York Captured</b></center>

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>ZEF vs Salamis Kai at 3DE</b></font></center>
<br>
The ZEF has seen its fair share of combat recently, but as the old saying goes, <i>There is no rest for the wicked.</i> With the untimely demise of Emil Myberg, the rest of the ZEF was looking for some revenge. Fortunately they found it in the form of a EFSF Salamis Kai battle ship all by its lonesome at 3 days from Earth. The mechanics work fast to get the damaged units of the ZEF battle ready or damn close to it.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The heavily damaged Salamis Kai, <i>Cortez</i>, was sitting at 3DE for repairs. The bridge captain didn't think they would get attacked all the way out here, but he manages to keep his crew on alert. The Federal mechanics work tirelessly to get the ship in some kind of decent shape just in case they do get attacked. The mechanics made damn sure that the weapon systems were in working order but in doing that they were late in starting to repair the targeting computers and the hull of the ship. If they did get attacked they would have to do the disgraceful method of spray and pray. Also with no mobile suits or balls to help in the defense they were in even more of a jam.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The ZEF pilots; Anya Wilds, Felix Mendashon, Florian Cuyler, Kenshiro Imawano, and Richard Banks all get suited up in their respective pilot suits. They all head off to their respective mobile suits and armors. The ZEF has two mobile armors with MPC cannons, a Gelgoog, a Perfect Zeong, and the Gelgoog Marine Commander type. Its safe to say that the ZEF packs one hell of a punch for just a five person team. Espically since they have a Bigro with its Anti-Battleship Mega Particle Cannon. That EFSF ship was going down in a blaze of fire.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The five MS/MA team heads out in search for the ship. Once they found it the Gelgoogs and the Perfect Zeong will take pop shots at the defenses of the ship while the Val Varo and Bigro come in from behind and deliver the killing blows. They approach the <i>Cortez</i> and begin their hit and run attacks. The Salamis Kai battle ship fired their cannons in all directions. This was going to be easy they all thought. The Val Varo comes from behind the fires its MPC cannons, just clipping the engines and the Bigro comes from underneath and blasts its Anti-Battleship MPC scoring the kill shot. The ship explodes and the ZEF fly off content with its victory.
<br><br>
