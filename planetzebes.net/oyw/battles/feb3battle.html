<br>
It was dark in one of the storage rooms aboard the Ol' Jove's Bones. The door slides open as the light from the hallway shone in and two shillouetes entered. 
The door closes shut and the lights power on, blinding one of the men who entered. Putting an arm up to shield his eyes from the light until he adjusted to them, 
Jacobin Conroy looked around the room they entered. A multitude of crates filled the room, though packed together so tightly that it made more room than would be expected. 
Turning back to the man who led him inside here, he spoke up, "You mean we're to... Here?"
<br><br>
Hands behind his back, the second man retorted, "My lad... Ye really question why I bring ye here?" The Wraith, Captain Samuel Riley, eyes closed and raising his brow, 
questioned his subordinate. "Now, listen 'ere. We're 'ere to hone those skills ye call yer own." Riley grinned and released his hands from behind his back and gripped 
the rapier at his side. Pointing it at Jacobin, he motioned towards his opponent to draw his own weapon. "Show me what a bilge rat can do."
<br><br>
Taking his own rapier from his side, Jacobin got into stance, immediately feeling the reason why his captain chose this room. Fighting in zero gravity. A confined area, 
but enough room to move about. Nodding to his opponent, showing he was ready, Jacobin lunged forward with his rapier. However, putting too much energy into his body's 
motion, he lost balance and started to fall forward.
<br><br>
Taking a lithe step to the side, Riley chuckled. "Lad, you know better to get used to your battlefield before engaging in combat! Now, come at me again!" He said as he took a 
swipe of his rapier through the stale air of the room and readying it again. Jacobin got back up to his feet after a nearby crate cushioned his 'fall' and moved towards Riley 
with a thrust, this time most of the force behind just the thrust and no heavy follow-throughs. A light connection of metal was heard as Riley swiped his rapier against Jacobin's, 
parrying his attack. Immediately recovering from the parry, Jacobin pulled back his arm and then swung out his rapier again overhead of Riley, only to be met with another parry.
<br><br>
Jacobin noticed that Riley was a little slow this time. No, he was getting used to his environment. With a grin, Jacobin started to lash out at Samuel Riley, causing his opponent 
to retreat as they both left the ground of the storage room. The clash of metal got louder and faster as they both started exchanging blows, not letting up on one another. Jacobin 
took one last rear of his rapier and swung it at Riley with a bit too much force. Riley fended off the attack only to be pushed back into the upper corner of the storage room, putting 
quite a gap between him and Jacobin.
<br><br>
Letting out a hearty laugh, the Captain shook his head. "Looks I 'ave this match, boy." The comment bought Riley some time as he pulled in his legs, turning and pushing himself off the 
upper corner of the room, rapier ready to be thrust. Seeing his opponent ready to 'jump' at him, Jacobin realized it was all too late to even do anything to react as he saw The Wraith 
soar right towards him, the rapier leaving a cut across Jacobin's left arm as Riley passed. "Ye lost, lad." Samuel Riley claimed victory in their spar as he looked up at his fellow pirate. 
If that had been a real battle, y'd be dead!" Smiling, he opened the door to the storage room and let is slide close behind him, leaving Jacobin alone to reflect.

Deep in the center of Guatemala, three Zakus made their way through the rainforest. Among them was Ferusha Glavdeen, who was caught in between of the two other units. Ahead of her was a Zaku Cannon, and behind her; a Zaku land type. Despite the time spent with them, she did not really care for the pilots, not even enough to remember their names. The only person she cared about was waiting for her back at base, probably waiting to fix up her Zaku if Ferusha was to run into the Federation Ground Forces. She cared even less about the pilots as just the other day she had heard them rambling about rumors of her sexual preference, but she didn't interupt; it was better to keep them guessing. It was a wonder that Clara hadn't heard of the rumors as well, or had she and was she playing dumb this entire time. What was her main concern was if anybody found out she was a newtype. As she thought about it, in the distance, some one was ready to target her. The dopp flying overhead couldn't even pick it up, as it could see nothing passed the canopy.

Meanwhile the hunter who had been eying his prey still had not made the first move. Instead, Bigsby had been contemplating his next step in his mind, playing every scenario back and forth until he had decided on an action. The Zakus were far enough apart that he could successfully get a potshot out on the squad's leader before the other two would be able to ract, or so he thought.
<br><br>

<br>
"Here goes nothing." muttered Bigsby, whiping the sweat from his forhead with his left arm, and his right arm grasping on the clutch; index finger hovering over the trigger.
<br><br>
An earie feeling crawled up Ferusha's spine, and she knew something was wrong. As the shot from Bigsby's railcannon was fired, she rotated her Zaku. She managed to limit the damage done to her unit by using the Zaku's shoulder shield to absorb the impact. Her Zaku was still severely damaged from the right side. Bigsby adjusted himself to take another shot, and then fired. 
<br><br>

<br>
"We've got company!" alerted Ferusha as she evaded the second shot with ease. Luckily her thrusters weren't damamged from the first shot.
<br><br>
"He's good." noted Bigsby. "That's enough attention for now, I should get out of..."
<br><br>

<br>
Before he could finish the sentance, his Desert GM was nailed by a shot from the shoulder mounted 180mm cannon of the MS-06K. The pilot managed to spot him as Desert type GM didn't blend too well in the jungle. The shot was extremely accurate not only due tot he pilot's skill, ut the fact that he knelt the Zaku on its knee, lessening the kickback of the shoulder cannon. Meanwhile, the other Zaku tackled Ferusha into cover, while also hailing her to check if she was alright.
<br><br>
Bigsby got up and retreated before the Zaku Cannon could pursue.

<br>Ferusha Galvadeen: 2 VP gained, Repairing 1</center>
