<br>
The mammoth green ship glided around its third geosynchronous orbit around earth since the marines of the [i]Musai-class[/i] Mecklen had started counting. The other [i]Musai[/i] of the Hellsing fleet were arrayed in a triangular formation. For the time being, these brown-helmeted Marines couldn't see their flagship or its sister ship. This caused concern. Abruptly, an alarm broke their thinking, and the group broke into small groups sent to specific parts of the ship. Running to the bridge, the Watch Officer announced minovsky particles were being detected from a small debris field.

<br><br>
Down at the hangar bay of the nearby Musai Seydlitz, the unmistakable sound of Zakus coming online combined with the frantic yelling of machine operators. There was nothing to suggest a Federation fleet coming so deep into Zeon space, so the launch crew was pretty anxious. Green giants dropped out of the Musai, weaving after each other to approach the unidentified signal.
<br><br>
The Mecklen had calmed down after that. The flagship was sighted behind a wayward asteroid, likely debris from a nearby larger one. The marines had returned to quarters, playing cards, and counting trivial things. Though the bridge was anxious it was largely undefended from attack, the marines were much calmer. They'd seen this show time and time again. Finally, the alarms ceased and an announcement went out. 
<br><br>
"Stand down. Another balloon."
<br><br>
Outside, the Zakus of the Markgraf and Seydlitz were racing to out-pop fake asteroids, fake debris, and minovsky powered engines.

<br>
In the airways above the Atlantic ocean, there flies the Zeon Gallop fleet commanded by Zeonic Officer Tony Knight. Little did he and his crew know that a Jet Core Booster squadron was doing their routine patrol. The squad noticed the blips on their radars and moved to intercept when they saw the Gallop fleet.
<br><br>

<br>
The Jet Core Boosters come up behind the Gallops and start firing their cannons at the fleet. Startled Tony Knight panicked and ordered the retreat of his ships. One of the Gallops in the rear was caught by the machine gun and missile firings of the JCB squadron and barely escaped only due to the JCB's running out of ammo.

<br>
The area surrounding Jaburo was still scorched from the epic battle waged only a week ago. While the base licked its wounds, two variations of the infamous Gundam designed patrolled its borders. The Heavy Gundam and Blue Destiny Unit 2, though cosmetically as different as possible, looked similar compared to their pilots. Thorvald Siggurdson sat in his cockpit, streaming an audio file “Scotland the Brave”. This wouldn't be a problem, if he didn't insist on leaving a communication line open with his partner, Aurem Senaiha. Aurem was forced to continue his patrol with his eyes closed, his hands clenching his ears in pain at the harsh sound. After an hour of such music, the usually quiet man was at his breaking point.
<br><br>
“Excuse me. Could you please turn that down slightly” Aurem asked his counterpart. “What do you expect me to do?” Thorvald yelled back. “Excuse me?” Aurem was surprised by the abrasive tone. “So you're deaf too, you clagtail cuddie dreik!” Thorvald hollared even louder. “You mistake my comment, sir.” Aurem tried to calm the situation before it escalated. “Do I? You think I'm dumb too?” Thorvald stopped his mobile suit, grabbing the Heavy Gundam by the shoulder. “No, I... Look...” Aurem tried again to settle the conflict, but was cut off by Thorvald. “Listen, you boony blathering numpty. The only way to settle this is to beat me in combat! Now are you a man, or a worthless blate like I know you are?” Thorvald growled while the Blue Destiny grabbed its beam saber. “I'm calling you a coward!” Thorvald activated his blade, forcing Aurem's hand.
<br><br>
The two units clashed sabers, Blue Destiny starting with the better position. The Heavy Gundam reached back with its free hand, grabbing one of its grenades. As the Destiny pressed down, the Heavy rolled the grenade just behind the Blue Destiny's foot, the detonation knocked the Blue Destiny off balance. With a quick shoulder thrust and backhand, the Heavy now stood atop the Blue Destiny, its back against the ground. “Nice one laddie.” Thorvald chuckled, the Blue Destiny rising back to its feet. Aurem was not willing to risk an engagement outside of the base with the fearsome EXAM system. “Why diddin ya strike? Oh! You're worried about the EXAM. No worries laddie, I'm still learning this suit, I don't think they've left it active.” Thorvald assured Aurem, unsure if his own words were true. Thorvald didn't give Aurem a chance to decide, reigniting both sabers and slashing at the Heavy. The battle fully underway, there was no turning back now. “First one to land a decisive blow wins.” Aurem dictated the terms of the spar. “Ha! I like you laddie. You're on.” Thorvald released a deep belly laugh as the battle continued.
<br><br>
Despite having an advantage in both sabers and speed, the Blue Destiny struggled to overwhelm the Heavy Gundam who used a combination of sword and open fist to parry all the Blue Destiny's attacks. Slash after slash, blow after blow, neither Gundam could land a direct hit. Aurem knew his limited skill with the Heavy Gundam may be his downfall. Not wanting to risk waiting for his opponent to stumble, the Heavy Gundam grabbed both of its remaining grenades. Tossing its saber forward like a spear, the Heavy was able to force the Blue Destiny back long enough to activate both grenades, one in each hand. Crossing his arms, he tossed the grenades to opposite ends of the Blue Destiny. The explosions knocked Thorvald off balance, giving Aurem the chance to fire the Heavy Gundam's cannon. The blast struck the Blue Destiny, only managing to destroy its arm shield. Tossing its sabers aside, the Blue Destiny rose to a a standing position, Thorvald's chuckling audible over the gears of the mobile suit. Its chest spung open a combination of machinecannon and missile fire erupted, striking the Heavy and tossing it away. As the Heavy slid along the soil, Aurem weighed his options. A prolonged battle would only risk further harm to both him and Thorvald. In one fluid motion, he grabbed the Heavy's beam rifle and fired it from his waste, striking the Blue Destiny just below the waist.
<br><br>
Alarms erupted all over Jaburo and Orange Base. Their spar had gone too far, and call after call from the base demanded their immediate halt. Glancing at the Blue Destiny's damage, Aurem sheathed the Heavy's weapons and began walking back to base, content in his victory. “Hey. We're not finished! Come back and face you doom!” Thorvald yelled after his opponent, unwilling to admit defeat.
