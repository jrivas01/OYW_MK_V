<br><br>
<b>October 17th, UC 0079</b>
<br><br>
The outward tranquility of Side 7 is about as real as those colorful commercials you see on television.  The major colony cluster of Green Noah & Green Oasis may look like peaceful settlements of humanity, but in truth they are the bastion of Federal Research and Development.  A measure of utmost importance to the Earth Federation if they are to win this war.  Much to the dread of the local populace, the fires of war already touched this colony cluster.  Char Aznable's <i>Falmel</i> was brought here to interrupt the Federation's "Project V", only to result in the mass evacuation of civilians onboard the White Base.
<br><br>
Months later, nothing much has changed about Green Noah & Green Oasis.  Neglected due to the other hotspots of the war-torn Earth Sphere, the scientists and engineers had been able to proceed unhindered in their research.  Now, as the Federal defense fleet files out of Green Noah's space dock it is joined by the Damocles Strike Force.
<br><br>
"Coffee, admiral?"
<br><br>
Rear Admiral Jamitov Heiman turned away from the <i>Antioch</i>'s bridge windows and towards the seaman.  The admiral shook his head, the half-frown on his stern face firmly telling the Federal soldier to stop wasting his time.
<br><br>
"What is Lieutenant Commander Daningham's status?" asked the admiral.  The Federal soldier stepped back as a more senior officer came forward.
<br><br>
"The commander reported that PROJECT PHANTOM has nearly completed all operations checks and will be ready on schedule."
<br><br>
"What of the sample?"
<br><br>
"Sample?  Oh... Officer Candidate Rachel Arronax is on the <i>Delphinus</i>.  Ensign Alexa Winters is briefing her as we speak."
<br><br>
"Splendid.  Have the fleet escorts form a perimeter while the <i>Antioch</i> and <i>Delphinus</i> conduct the examination.  Inform the ship captains that we will need plenty of room of this demonstration."
<br><br>
The officer took note of Jamitov's choice of words before turning away.  Sample, examination, and demonstration.  It is as if the Rear Admiral already knew the result and everything including the crew of the <i>Antioch</i> is expendable.
<br><br>
As Jamitov looked at the captured red Zeon ship, a knowing smile tug on his lips.  How convenient that a wretched spacenoid ship will deliver to him the spacenoid that would prove to the Earth Federal Forces that his PROJECT PHANTOM will finally win this war against Zeon.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Want to know the secret to my success? It's because I'm me."
<br><br>
The ever bashful Private 2nd Class Marc Simmons leaned back in his chair as he laughed at his trademark line.  The GM-E pilot is enjoying the priveleges of not being locked in the brig anymore.  Despite the abuse and glares since his joyride in the RX-78-1, Simmons still believed that the ride is worth it.
<br><br>
"Though, if I have to say anything about the Zeeks," concluded Simmons as he shifted his weight around, causing the chair to squeak," is that they make-."
<br><br>
"Oh, shut up you idiots and pay attention!"
<br><br>
The sudden voice of Ensign Alexa Winters startled Officer Candidate Rachel Arronax from her daydream as Simmons looked around to see where the voice came from.  Leaning against the wall is Seaman Recruit Otaktai Lone Wolf.  The Lakota Sioux Native American a peaceful zen-like expression as the sound of angry footsteps made their way up to the head of the room.
<br><br>
The light darken as the projector screen came on.  A very long metal pointer reached up from below the screen.
<br><br>
"Orders are from Jamitov himself," huffed the height challenged ensign," the GM Juggler will deploy to THIS location where it will meet up with PROJECT PHANTOM.  The rest of you idiots will out out THERE with the rest of the ships."
<br><br>
The metal pointer moved over the various formations on the diagram.  "Now, any questions?"
<br><br>
"Yeah, I've got a question," spoke up Simmons," ... where are you right now exactly?"
<br><br>
"I'm right here you crazy thief!"  All they can see is the metal pointer waved in frustration.
<br><br>
Simmons tried to hide a chuckle but the ever bitter ensign heard it anyway.
<br><br>
"I swear Simmons if you are wearing those ridicolous sunglasses of yours in a dark room, I WILL HAVE YOU EXECUTED!"
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Far, far away beyond the border where the Green Noah & Green Oasis colony cluster turns into the empitness of Side 7, a dark shape flew unobserved.  The <i>Blackguard</i>, an SS-operated ship of the new Musai Final-Type design had slipped easily into Federal Territory.  The unusual black paint job is testimony to the ship's purpose.  This is a special operations group, picked for the most dangerous of missions.
<br><br>
The captain of the <i>Blackguard</i> turned as a SS Colonel stepped onto the bridge.
<br><br>
"Ah, you came at a good time," the captain said," our recon team is just returning."
<br><br>
"Oh?" asked the SS Colonel," and the news?"
<br><br>
"Our Zaku Flipper reported that a flotilla of Salamis-class ships are holding a perimeter around Green Noah & Green Oasis.  In the direct center between the two colonies is a Magellan and the captured Gwazine."
<br><br>
The SS Colonel spat at the mentioning of the Zeon vessel in enemy hands.  "A disgrace but one that can be fixed.  How long until we commence operations?"
<br><br>
"Matter of minutes," confirmed the captain," we need to refuel the Zaku Flipper and her escorts.  Your men and their equipment are already on the Komusai."
<br><br>
"Very well, I'll see to them," declared the SS Colonel," Sieg Zeon."
<br><br>
"Sieg Zeon," came the reply.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The GM Juggler rested inside the Zeon-made cage in the <i>Delphinus</i>'s massive hangar bay.  The only other units there right now is the two GM Light Armors, Simmon's GM-E, and the lone Saberfish fighter.
<br><br>
Arronax sat inside the GM Juggler's cockpit going over preflight checks with mechanics.  A small figure floated up to the open cockpit door and shoved aside one of the mechanics.
<br><br>
"I can't believe you are still wearing that pile of trash!" accused Ensign Winters, waving a small finger at Arronax's patched up flight suit.  Arronax sighs, having heard this argument before.
<br><br>
"So you better come back, so I can get you a new pilot suit."
<br><br>
Winters was gone before a confused Arronax could figure out what just happen.  Before long the mechanics gave her the thumbs up and the cockpit hatch came down.  She stepped in line behind the other Federal Mobile Suits aboard the <i>Delphinus</i>.  One by one they left the massive doors of the Gwazine-class vessesl.  The GM Juggler waved as the other three MS went towards the Salamis defense line.
<br><br>
Unknown to her, more than one pair of eyes watched the GM Juggler's departure.  On board the <i>Antioch</i>, Jamitov tilted his head forward as he followed the light sparkle that was the GM Juggler.  It amused him greatly that this may be the last anyone will ever see of that pilot.  A short distance away, Lieutenant Commander Dangingham is barking orders as the mysterious Zephyr Phantom Unit 1 is launched into space.  Even further away, the sensors of the <i>Blackguard</i>'s Zaku Flipper caught the sudden movement from the Gwazine on camera.</i>
<br><br>
In front of this vast audience, Rachel Arronax arrived at her appointed rendezvous point.  A small feeling of dread nibbled at her mind while Arronax waited.  She remembered the psycommu tuning sessions ordered by Jamitov and the pain the Newtype suffered at his hands.  Arronax could swear the Rear Admiral is out to kill her and today is no different.
<br><br>
Suddenly her communications gear chimed.  Oddly enough, it is a typed message instead of a voice transmission.
<br><br>
"TEST STARTED," read the blinking message on her console.
<br><br>
Suddenly an explosion rocks the GM Juggler, causing it to spin wildly out of control.  Arronax's heartrate went through the roof as she tried searching for her assailant.  The starfield on her screens spun with no sign of the attacker.  But what worries her the most is that the Pyscommu System isn't registering anything to her.
<br><br>
Then came a blur of white and flashes of gunfire.  The GM Juggler pulled itself together as Arronax used the tracers to orient herself against her attacker.  It is at this moment that the GM Juggler pilot came face to face with Jamitov's trump card against spacenoids.
<br><br>
She had seen that face before, on Issa Kobayashi's RX-78-1 and the RX-78-2 Gundam on Earth.  But this one looked different from the others.  Worse yet, there is nothing where she expected something.
<br><br>
That mystery will have to wait however, as the Zephyr Phantom Unit 1 proceeded with its programmed directive.  Another 360mm shell left its hyper bazooka as the 90mm machinegun of the Zephyr Phantom blew off chunks of the GM Juggler's armor.
<br><br>
Arronax paid no attention to the small chorus of alarms starting in her cockpit.  She drew the Juggler's own 90mm machinegun and fired a long burst at the closing prototype.
<br><br>
To her horror, much like many other Zeon pilots' expressions throughout the war, the 90mm rounds merely plinked off the Zephyr Phantom's tough Lunar Titanium armor.  The GM Juggler backed up as Arronax hurriedly tried to put as much space between her and this killing machine as possible.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Wow, they are really going at it aren't they?"
<br><br>
Officer Candidate Fierte Aluin watched with his bridge crew the spectacle of flickering lights in the far distance outside the Salamis's bridge windows.  Every so often a different flash of light burst and faded into the darkness of space.
<br><br>
"I'm glad I'm here and not over there..." muttered Aluin.  Suddenly his communications officer yelled.
<br><br>
"We lost contact with unit 2 from the <i>Luzar</i>!  Weapons discharge confirmed!"
<br><br>
Aluin clenched his teeth as the bridge lights turn to battlestations red.  So much for just watching.
<br><br>
"Enemy Musai on sensors!  They opened fire!"
<br><br>
"Evasives!" cried Aluin.
<br><br>
The Salamis rolled over, its single engine flaring to life.  Four pairs of mega particle blasts came at the Salamis, eatting away the armor off the port side.  The burst of emergency transmissions soon reached the ears of Marc Simmons and Otaktai Lone Wolf.  But before they know it, four Zaku II High Mobility Types bore down on them as space became an elaborate light show.
<br><br>
Onboard the Musai Final Type, the captain watched as the other Salamis hurried to the <i>Narwhal</i>'s position.  "Are we still getting readings from the Zaku Flipper?"
<br><br>
"Yes captain! All data are being uploaded to our ship as we speak!"
<br><br>
"And the colonel?"
<br><br>
"The Federals have not detected the Kommusai yet!"
<br><br>
Far below the Federal fleet, a lone black-painted Komusai sailed under the blossoming combat.  Onboard, SS troopers in their trademark black armor check their weapons and equipment.  Not even the void of space is going to stop Gihren's soldiers.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Onboard the <i>Antioch</i>, Jamitov is feeling rather pleased with himself as he listened to the status reports on the GM Juggler and the Zephyr Phantom.  Already at the start, his new machine is overwhelming the Newtype pilot.
<br><br>
"Admiral!"  Jamitov raised a single eyebrow.  "Zeon ship detected at the defense perimeter.  Musai-class!"
<br><br>
"Only one ship?"
<br><br>
"Yes Admiral.  <i>Narwhal</i>, <i>Capella</i>, <i>Amiens</i>, <i>Luzar</i>, and <i>Dauntless</i> are moving in to intercept."
<br><br>
"Very well."  Jamitov's good mood is gone.  Well, it's not surprising that Zeon would interfere.  At least it is only one ship.
<br><br>
"Status of the examination?"
<br><br>
"GM Juggler had deployed wired bits!"
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
What looked like a RB-79 Ball with a pair of beam guns appeared and after a two second pause, released a burst of beam energy.  At the same time, the GM Juggler and another similar device opened fire as well.
<br><br>
The three-way energy attack would have killed the average Zeon grunt, but the Zephyr Phantom is not your average enemy.  It spun as it closed in on Arronax, the two large beam resistant shields moving into position to deflect the beam shots with calculated precision.
<br><br>
A gasp escaped Arronax's lips as the Zephyr Phantom is upon her again.  Her 90mm machinegun was destroyed a long time ago and she used up the last shots in her beam gun.  As the Zephyr Phantom grew larger on her screens, the GM Juggler's head vulcans fired futilely as the two Wired Bits try to hit the killing machine again.
<br><br>
Suddenly the Zephyr Phantom's hand juts out and Arronax's screen goes blank. The automated mobile suit's hand grabbed the GM Juggler by the neck and proceeded to rip out what would be its jugular had the MS been a living being.
<br><br>
Arronax is still fighting for her life though as the arms of the GM Juggler try to pry the death machine off her.  But the Zephyr Phantom is not to be denied as it sank a beam saber into the shoulder socket of both arms.  The GM Juggler's head is torn free as the arms immediately went limp.  Then like a savage beast, the Zephyr Phantom began bashing the front section of the GM Juggler's armor with its own head.
<br><br>
Back on the Antioch, Jamitov's good mood is back.  The Zephyr Phantom Unit 1 has successfully reduced the GM Juggler to a defenseless piece of trash.  It is everything he wanted out of the machine and it is performing perfectly.
<br><br>
"Lieutenant?  I would have some of that coffee now," said Jamitov.
<br><br>
"Admiral..." said a concerned officer," shouldn't we recall the unit?  It is about to kill the pilot."
<br><br>
"So?" said Jamitov as he took the cup of coffee," accidents happen.  How unfortunate."
<br><br>
Jamitov didn't need to look to know that the bridge crew is exchanging glances at that remark.  He didn't have a need for the spacenoid anymore and Jamitov is fine with that.  A sudden chime then caught his attention.
<br><br>
"Sensor contact lower left quadrant!  It's behind the defense line!"
<br><br>
"What?" spat Jamitov.
<br><br>
"Target confirmed, it's a Komusai!"
<br><br>
"Order the ships back!  The Musai's a diversion," ordered Jamitov as he leaned forward in his chair," and recall the Zephyr Phantom Unit One!  They may be after it!"
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The SS colonel can barely fit into the Komusai's cockpit in his Panzergrenadier armor.  The pilot looked up with a worried expression on his face.
<br><br>
"They spotted us?" asked the colonel.
<br><br>
"Yes!  The Salamis ships are moving away from the <i>Blackguard</i>!  They are about to open fire!"
<br><br>
It is true, the three Salamis from Green Noah are turning towards the Zeon shuttle while the Narwhal and Capella hold their ground against the <i>Blackguard</i>.  Mega particle fire began raining down on the Komusai, spelling the inevitable for the crew.
<br><br>
The captain of the <i>Blackguard</i> watched the static filled transmission from the SS Colonel.
<br><br>
"<i>Captain... kshhhhhhskk... can not reach.. hskkkkkkkksk... target.</i>"
<br><br>
"Roger that sir..."
<br><br>
"<i>... Will... kshhhhhskkkkk... hold... hssskkskk... attention... skkkhskkk... you... ksssssssh... leave...</i>"
<br><br>
"Yes sir, we will escape with the data we have of the enemy's test."
<br><br>
"<i>... Sieg...kshhhhhhhhhhhsk... Zeon...ksssssshhhk!</i>"
<br><br>
"Sieg Zeon."
<br><br>
It was just as well too.  Marc Simmons pounced on the Zaku Flipper with his beam saber, gorging out the Zeon recon unit.  The Zaku II HMTs already fell victim to the GM Light Armors and the combined firepower of the <i>Narwhal</i> and <i>Capella</i>.  But as the Federal force turned to take on the black painted Musai crusier, the <i>Blackguard</i> released a wave of missiles.  A wave of explosions baffled the Federal ships from the sudden missile attack at point blank range.
<br><br>
By the time the Simmons, Lone Wolf, and Aluin's <i>Narwhal</i> got things back under control, the <i>Blackguard</i> had disappeared.  It will be another hour before the Federal forces are confident that there are no other Zeon units in the area.
<br><br>
Almost as an afterthought, six RB-79 Balls found the mangled torso of the GM Juggler.  They brought the beat up mobile suit back to the <i>Delphinus</i>, where a Medical Team transferred the injured Rachel Arronax to a shuttle for transport to Green Noah's hospital.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Hours later, Lieutenant Patrick "Packie" Foley stiffled a yawn as he gently nudged the GM Command Space Type past the boundary markers for the Green Noah & Green Oasis Colony Cluster.  He left the <i>Nebula III</i> two days ago and is more than glad to see his destination.
<br><br>
Guidance lights showed him the way into Green Noah's hangar bay.  Along the way, he recognized the Damocles Strike Force in the shipyard.  Upon touching down, the former Zeon instructor asked a mechanic a question.
<br><br>
"So what did I miss?"
<br><br>
