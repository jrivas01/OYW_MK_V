David Mass' Ball watched from a distance as four escape pods were taken into the Lucifer's Fury. He smiled knowing they contained guerrillas meant to attack and take over the ship. He chuckled knowing they were walking into a trap.
<br><br>
The escape pod doors opened, and the hired men spilled out into a hail of gunfire. It was a short battle, but it's purpose was served, the EFSF would now get word that David's mission failed, and his feddie contact would see him as the rogue who would sacrifice men for the Federation's cause.

Veronica Wu stood peering out into space, her executive officer stood behind her. 
<br><br>
"He devised a magnificent ruse." She said, Her XO nodding in agreement. 
<br><br>
"There's only one thing missing."  She said, making a small gesture to the gunnery officer, followed shortly by a blast of mega particles streaking out from the Lucifer's Fury. A small explosion was seen in the distance, "There," She said, "Now his client will be convinced."
