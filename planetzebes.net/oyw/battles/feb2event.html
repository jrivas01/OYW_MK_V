"<i>Explain... to me again... why are we... flying in this... soup?</i>"
<br><br>
The words coming over the radio are broken up by the fierece snowstorm raging around the Alaskan Air Defense Wing.  The severe weather baffles the Federal patrol harshly.  Only grim determination allowed them to maintain some sort of a formation.
<br><br>
"<i>Because... you had to... piss off... the base commander... that's why... you idiot.</i>"
<br><br>
Suddenly a new voice laced with static caught the flight leader's attention.  After acknowledging, he called the rest of his squadron together.
<br><br>
"Ease on it boys," he said into the microphone," the Dish craft says we got some odd readings below us.  Let's check it out."
<br><br>
"<i>I ain't... going down there... boss... why.. do... we?</i>"
<br><br>
"Because I say so, that's why!  Now lock those flaps and let's roll!"
<br><br>
One by one, the Tin Cods peel off towards the middle of the snow storm, their Dish aircraft following behind them at a distance.  Suddenly, something appeared and closed rapidly.
<br><br>
A vital ten seconds passed before someone shouted the obvious.  "<i>Dopps!  Dopps!</i>"
<br><br>
On the other side of the near mid-air collision, Dopp pilots are shouting at each other and their Lugunn.  "<i>Tin Cods!  Tin Cods!</i>"
<br><br>
In the wild encounter, nerves buckled and ordinance went flying.  Air-to-air missiles launched before getting a target lock and vulcan guns belched flame wildly.  The sudden twister of weapons fire scored more hits on friendly planes than foe.
<br><br>
In the distance, the Jet Core Boosters of the 122nd Bomber Wing recieved a distress call from the Alaskan Air Defense's Dish shortly before it was shot out of the air.  The Jet Core Boosters open their throttles to the max and joined in on the wild melee in the snowstorm.
<br><br>
The Tin Cods are down to a pair right now as greater numbers allowed the Zeon force to absorb more mistakes than the Federal patrol.  The surviving Dopps swarmed over the last of the Alaskan aircraft before turning around to face the incoming Jet Coreboosters.
<br><br>
The 122nd Bomber Wing arrived just in time to see their Tin Cod comrades go down in flames.  Motivated to avenge the airmen, neither of the six pilots saw a new flight of Dopps come down on their left flank.  Requisitioned for this possibility, they caught the Jet Core Boosters by surprised, forcing them to break formation.  By the time they got organized again, the other group of Dopps was upon them.  One by one the Jet Coreboosters are picked off in the white confusion of the snowstorm.
<br><br>
Below the heartpounding high stakes air battle over the West Arctic, the ships of the fleet "G-Force" casually go along their way.  The howling winds of the snowstorm deafens them from the battle above.  Onboard the <i>Decimator</i>, Alec Irusk took a sip of his warm coffee.  The warmonger pondered the aerial battle he cannot see.  In the <i>Hochstetter</i>, Bryce Hollerfelt adjusted controls in his Hidolfr.  They will get their chance to fight, but not today.
