Almost hidden in the debris of Side 5 sat a small Zeon base.  Built as the forward base of the Zeon Expeditionary Force, the "Purgatorio" base has a history well suited for its name.  Named for the italian word for "Purgatory", it was originally constructed by Oberscharfuhrer Laredo Veil as an daring tactic against the EFSF Damocles Fleet.  
<br><br>
At a dark time in the career of the ZEF, the SS officer and the base sacrificed themselves to do damage to the Damocles Fleet which also contained the stolen Gwazine-class <i>Delphinus</i>.  Weeks later, the base is rebuilt by the new ZEF commander Lieutenant Colonel Veronica Wu.  Now a full-fledged Colonel, she had used the reborn base as a supply and rallying force for her campaign against the EFSF.
<br><br>
But a base named for a place between death and heaven will continue to be caught in a cycle of life and death.
<br><br>

<br>
There it is.  From the shower of wreckage that had cluttered the windows of his ship, the space station known has "Purgatorio" is now in clear sight.
<br><br>
Commodore Evander Creed took a puff of his cigar.  Rich in favor, the taste made his blood pulse with excitement.  It has been far too long since he last commanded a ship in battle.  What better way to announce his return to the battlefield than to destroy an enemy base?
<br><br>
"Have the fleet begin the attack," growled Creed as his bridge crew flinched before carrying out his desires.
<br><br>
The Bollocks Fleet left the Shoal Zone and slowly turn to form a united battle line.  On board the Zeon base, numerous soldiers rush their positions.  The few fixed defenses of the base pointed towards the Federal fleet as the single squad of mobile suits powered up.
<br><br>
Creed looked over at his communications officer.  "Tell Quintal to get ready."
<br><br>
Over at the Fuji-class <i>The Factory</i>, the optimistic Captain Nacho Quintal watch as his crew do their work.  The former artist held onto his armrests as the missile tubes on the Fuji-class ship let loose their ordinance.
<br><br>
The <i>Revenant</i> joined <i>The Factory</i> in a volley of missiles.  But rather than home in on the Zeon base, the missiles explode prematurely.  At that moment, Purgatorio's mega particle cannons open fire.
<br><br>
The beams of energy lanced out only to dissipate against the cloud of anti-beam particles.  Before the command staff of Purgatorio can adapt, the Bollocks fleet launches an immense wave of high explosive warheads.  Purgatorio's MS squad ducked around the large artillery as they rush the Federal warships.
<br><br>
As explosions ripple around the Zeon base, the Purgatorio mobile suit garrison came across the few times in space where the EFSF outnumbered Zeon in mobile suits.  The horde of beam spray gun carrying GMs lifted their weapons and fired.
<br><br>
For a short ironic moment, the beams from their spray guns dissipated from the flickering remnants of the anti-beam shower.  This allowed the Zaku Kais to pour 90mm fire into the GM ranks and for the Zaku II Minelayer to heave high explosives like grenades.
<br><br>
But the brief respite was shorter than the time it took to read this sentence.  Before the Zeon mobile suits can open fire again or even move, they are torn apart from a frenzy of weapons fire.
<br><br>
Seeing their mobile suits and heavy weapons fail, the command staff at Purgatorio used their last card.  Bursting to life, the dozens of rocket equipped asteroids leaped from their hiding places and raced towards the Bollocks Fleet.
<br><br>
But Evander Creed had read the reports of his predecessors.  He is not about to repeat the failures of Patrick Foley and Rachel Arronax.
<br><br>
Like a professional football team, the GMs fell back.  The combined concentrated wave of AA and beam spreay guns tore through the shower of asteroids, effectively neutralizing what would have been severe damage.  Due to the law of probability however, several fragments hit a few ships causing superficial damage.
<br><br>
Confident that the Zeon base has used up all of its might, the Bollocks Fleet formed a ring around Purgatorio.  For the next half hour, the heavy weapons of the Federal warships poured into the space station until it ruptured into a massive fireball.  Again.
<br><br>
Evander Creed smiled as he watched the explosion be snuffed out by the vaccum of space.  He never liked prisoners anyway.
