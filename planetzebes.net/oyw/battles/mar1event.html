"So these are our ringside seats for the main event?" Captain Rodriguez of the Salamis-class Albireo thought aloud as he looked out across the space between the halves of the Cygnus Fleet. It's flagship and mobile suit carrier had gone ahead of the Albireo, which would remain behind with it's public class ally to give Zeon forces something to think about if they followed behind.
<br><br>
"Any sign of the enemy?" Rodriguez asked, pacing the bridge as though he couldn't contain his energy.
<br><br>
"We've got nothing sir, it's quiet out there."
<br><br>
"Of course it's quiet! It's SPACE! I didn't ask if you heard any--WHAT'S THAT!?" Rodriguez shouted, pointing frantically at the red object speeding directly toward them. 
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>

<br>
Val Varo streaked through space toward the enemy Salamis, it's pilot confident in the speed and raw power of the crimson mobile armor.
<br><br>
"This is Mendalshon, I'm starting my run." Felix radioed back to his comrades, glancing over the control panel as he flipped various switches to bring the mega particle cannon online. As he looked back up, a horde of missiles from the Salamis filled his viewscreen. 
<br><br>
"oh shi-" Was all he could get out before explosions kicked his machine into a spin, struggling to gain control, he had little choice but to break off.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Missiles are awesome!" Rodriguez shouted triumphantly, "Don't let him escape! Fire the Mega Particle Cannons!"
<br><br>
Fire erupted from the Salamis' guns, but not the form of fire the captain had hoped for. In quick succession the main weapons of the ship exploded, the bridge catching sight of beams of light ripping the upper deck gun to shreds. 
<br><br>
"Is it my imagination, or are we ENGULFED IN FLAMES!?" Rodriguez yelped as the beams, which seemed to come from nowhere, continued to ignite his ship in various places.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>

<br>
The battered Val Varo managed to limp away from the battlefield, covered by an artillery barrage and the fact that the enemy vessel now had it's hands full with Florian's bit attack. Not far from his position, he could see the white Dom PTT being 'guarded' by Emil Myberg's Rick Dom.
<br><br>
"This works great, I don't have to charge into the thick of it, and if anything breaks through all that mess, I'll see them coming a mile away." Emil said to himself. Just behind him was Florian in his enhanced Dom, silent as usual. He was struggling a bit to handle the pressure of running such an all-out attack with his bits, but the job was getting done, soon the Salamis would sink. Through the wincing that accompanied each series of shots, he noticed the Val Varo arrive, and with his suit's free hand, he signed a shot message.
<br><br>
"It's over, don't bother sending in the mobile suits." Felix read the hand signs aloud and waving Val Varo's one good arm in reply.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Warning alarms were ringing all over the Albireo, it's bow section almost completely severed now, and the constant stream of criss-crossing beams methodically searching for a kill shot. By now the crew was abandoning ship, aside from the captain, who stared out from the bridge intently. He had clearly lost his mind, and the crew had long since given up trying to pull him to an escape pod.
<br><br>
"I... I see now, I understand! It's all going to explode!!!!" He shouted as his eyes finally caught sight of the tiny bits that were slowly killing his ship. "It's beautiful! Like fireworks before a festival!"
<br><br>
Two bits lined up side by side just above and ahead of the bridge, the captain could easily see them now, and an insane smile spread across his face.
<br><br>
"SEE YOU AT THE PARTY!!!!" He screamed as the pair of beams ripped through the bridge on either side of him, igniting the air around him before piercing through the rear wall and floor, finally finding their way to the reactor and creating a blossom of flame that spewed fiery pieces of metal outward. It really was like a giant fireworks display.

<br>
Off the eastern coast of North America, the Federal fleet named "Odessa Task Force Zeta" steamed forward towards its next target.  It's violent entrance into the Zeon controlled area of North America included the demise of a Zeonic armor division and a a Jukon submarine.  Now, on the handrails of <i>Lleu Llaw Gyffes</i>, Sergeant Scott Archer admired the distant coast.
<br><br>
"This used to be Federation territory. It feels like it has been so long since the war started." commented Scott to himself.
<br><br>
"Don't worry, Seargent, we intend to take it back." replied a familiar voice. It was none other than Lieutenant Jim Irwin.
<br><br>
"So where are you from, kid?" asked Irwin as he siezed up the Core Booster pilot
<br><br>
"Born and raised in New York, Sir!" replied Archer as he did a quick salute.
<br><br>
"Is that so? Must be personal. I myself hail from Iowa." replied rwin as they watched a pair of Tin Cods fly off the Himalaya's flight deck.  "Here, best to eat your rations while things are quiet."
<br><br>
Scott caught the ration pack.  "Thanks for Lieutenant."
<br><br>
"You can pay me back by making it through this war." responded Irwin.
<br><br>
"Yes Sir!" shouted Scott, when suddenly a noise made their heads turn.
<br><br>
Below decks, Sergeant Hirsch Munchek was sitting on top of the Waterproof Gundam, using his time to catch up on his reading. His focus was soon disturbed by the arrival of a GM pilot, who had given Hirsch a questionable look.
<br><br>
"Why are you reading at a time like this?" asked the pilot.
<br><br>
"I heard once Winston Churchill read a book every night, even during the Blitz. He said it made him think better. It's how I like to run things. I think. I'm sure that doesn't mean that much to you." replied Hirsch in a very harsh tone.
<br><br>
The pilot took the hints and left Hirsch to himself. Hirsch had been bitter, as any squad leader would be after losing their team. He took to blaming himself, a common symptom of survivor's guilt. He deemed himself unworthy of piloting his Waterproof Gundam, but he would regardless when repairs where done.
<br><br>
And then the hangar bay erupted into screaming klaxxons.  
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Flight Sergeant Gil Krundel pressed the massive Grabro underwater mobile armor forward towards the Federal fleet.  Already, a wave of six anti-ship torpedoes are ahead of him.  The torpedoes raced towards the Federal fleet whose naval vessels are trying to evade the warheads.
<br><br>
Don Escargots circled in the air, hoping to draw him off as GM Divers plunge into the water.  But Krundle isn't going to let them deter him from his goal.  The two Z'Goks accompanying him pop out of the water and rained mega particle fire on the Federal aircraft.  The sudden appearance of two more enemy mobile suit compounded the fleet's urgency in fending off the attackers.  
<br><br>
The fleet's newest asset, a veteran GM Sniper, looked up from his barge at the commotion around him.  His confusion quickly turned to panic as the barge was torn away from under him.  As water clouded his optics, the last thing the pilot saw was a face that came straight out of those deep sea horror movies.
<br><br>
Krundel let the broken pieces of the GM Sniper fall into the dark depths of the ocean.  The Grabro turned and then released a wave of anit-MS torpedoes behind the initial torepdo barrage.  The GM Divers were too busy trying to save the ships to notice the torpedoes aiming for them.  One survived the attack, being bounced out of range by the pressure waves from  the torpedoes that killed his comrade.  But his luck ran out when Krundle grabbed him and then crushed the struggling GM Diver like an egg.
<br><br>
It was the sight of the Grabro crumbling the hapless GM Diver to bits that greeted Munchek when he entered the water.  He faced a Grabro before in a previous attack on the <i>U-87 Lorelay</i> and barely won that one.  Without hesitation, Munchek pulled out his underwater beam rifle and began firing.
<br><br>
Krundle felt the hits of the beams and for a moment was surprised by the counterattack.  Then he swung the other massive claw arm only to see the Federal aquatic mobile suit evade it expertly.  The leviathan discarded the dead GM Diver as Munchek furged forward to meet him.
<br><br>
Claws and beam picks slashed and stabbed in the bubbling water.  Torpedoes flew back and forth.  But the nimble Gundam kept moving out of the way and Munchek's torpedoes kept getting caught in Krundle's defensive Freeze Yard.
<br><br>
Above the water, Archer's Core Booster banked into a turn as the pilot saw the wake of anti-ship torpedoes hit the three Federal naval ships.
<br><br>
"DAMN!" he cursed," I have to do something!"
<br><br>
"<i>Do we look like we're Don Escargots?</i>" asked Irwin as his damaged Tin Cod pulled up close,"<i> it's all up to the aqua-boys.</i>"
<br><br>
Munchek knows this all too well.  If he backed off now, the Zeon monster in front of him would rip the ships' hull to shreds.  Krundle knew that if he can get past this last challenger, there will be no one to stop his massacre.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the Waterproof Gundam's scissor anchor shot out and clamped down on the Grabro's forehead.  Like a winch, Munchek pulled himself right onto the Grabro's face, stabbed a beam pick into the armor, and unloaded his two underwater grenades.
<br><br>
The explosion sent Munchek's mobile suit spinning away and nearly breaking the water's surface.  For Krundle, every alert on his control panels began to light up.  Groaning with disappointment, he pulled the underwater mobile armor away from the fleet.  Soon, he is flanked by his two Z'Goks as they pulled him to safety.
<br><br>
Munchek was worrying about how he was going to get back on board the ship in his damaged mobile suit when he heard a thud.  For a panicking moment, he thought the Grabro got him.  Then he saw the GM visor of Charles Gano's Aqua GM.
