"Shit, man, there's always <i>something</i> going on out here, and I, for one, am not currently opposed to the thought of just letting any Zeon forces pass us if it lets me stay near this heater a second longer."
<br><br>
"Are you serious? If we don't shoot at, or at least report anything we see, our asses will be too toasty for even you, care of General Revil."
<br><br>
"Whatever, man, all I know is that I want to stay near this hea- Hold on, did you hear something?"
<br><br>
"What, now you're paranoid too?"
<br><br>
"Oh shit, Tim, look at the radar."
<br><br>
"Oh shit, we shouldn't have turned the alerts o-"

<br>
"Allllllllllllllllllright, guys! Destroy all those Type 61s! ZAKU TOMOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORK!" Snow blackened with ash and smoke billowed from the husks of Federation tanks while gunshots cracked out and spit bullets across the battlefield. A storm of Zakus rained down on the convoy, and at the head of the storm was Ando Shoji in his Shin Zaku II. He ran along the ground and swiped at the armored vehicles with his heat blades, cleaving a pair of the tanks neatly in two as he combined the hatchets into one gigantic weapon. Overhead, the Zak Machine Eagle circled like a vulture; a  large, red, vulture, only slightly less aerodynamic than the real thing.
<br><br>
"Tomohawk BOOOOMERANG!" The giant heat weapon shredded another Type 61, and the green Zakus accompanying Ando Shoji on his courageous venture picked off stragglers who ran from the doomed vehicles. After all, the lieutenant didn't exactly have any anti-personnel weaponry, and the Zaku pilots weren't too sure he'd bother with them even if he did. 
<br><br>
Finally, the battlefield was silent, and the Shin Zaku's tomohawk stood uprightly in the packed earth, and its owner rested a hand on it, watching the sun rise. The Mobile Suit's silhouette stretched backwards, and fell on the Zakus who assisted in the attack. An impressive sight to be sure, but only one thought passsed through each of the pilots' minds: "Don't you think the lieutenant is a little too dramatic sometimes?"

<br>
The Falmel hung suspended in Earths Orbit. The scout type Musai was stationed there to guard Zeon's interest in Earths Orbit. This mostly involved intercepting all Federation traffic, and any other unauthorized vessels who might attempt to enter or leave orbit. And it just so happens the Falmel was currently detecting a ship attempting to leave orbit today.
<br><br>
Boone entered the bridge to hear the comms men calling out a position. "Whats our status?" he asked the XO on the bridge. The XO turned sharply and gave Boone a quick salute. "We've detected a vessel of unknown origins attempting to exit Earths Orbit. We're currently on an intercept course. It doesn't appear to be the Federation Sir." Replied the XO. Boone nodded. "Good work. Go ahead and launch two of our Zaku's just to be safe." ordered Boone. The XO acknowledged as Boone walked over to the Comms man. " As soon as we're in range. Order the vessel to turn back or it will be fired upon." said Boone. The Comms man acknowledged and turned his attention back to his console.
<br><br>

<br>
The alarms on the Workhorse went off with a start when two Zaku's and a Musai appeared on their radar.  In the seconds it took John Cassidy to reach the bridge, the order to turn back had already come through. "What!" Yelled Cassidy. "Tell them we aren't with the Federation." he ordered. Seconds later a response came through. "This is Zeon territory and you don't have clearance to move through the area. Turn back now, this is your final warning." came the reply. "Damn it!" said John as he was forced to order his ship to come about and flee from the zeon patrol.

<br>
Despite the best attempts from politicians and governments to plant a flag or draw an invisible line declaring their domains, there are always those gray areas where civilization is oblivious to what is going on.
<br><br>
Such is the case with the Black Rock Pirates as they swept through the Earth Sphere.  Although the warring governments of the Earth Federal Forces and the Duchy of Zeon are aware of their presence thanks to the hijacking of the <i>Solarium Masquerade</i>, the Black Rock Pirates are only a footnote in their everday briefings.  Thanks to this, they can move with relative impunity.
<br><br>
The bright endless starfield is soon broken by the flaring of thruster engines as two Zaku II Cs flew in unison.  They are still painted the light green of the Duchy of Zeon, but the golden emblem of that faction has been replaced by the more darker Black Rock Pirate banner.
<br><br>
"<i>Okay, dearest, let's stop here.</i>"
<br><br>
The former banker eased on his controls a little.  James Radcliffe spun his Zaku II C around.  He watched as Addie Joiner's Zaku II C backed off a little.  Both rogue mobile suits pulled the bolt on their 120mm machineguns.  Radcliffe prefered the orderly environment of a his own deskjob.  It's a shame that fate brought him here.  Although his strength is with mathematics, Radcliffe can understand the necessity of practicing combat in an unforgiving society.
<br><br>
What troubles him is the woman in his "allied" mobile suit.  Addie Joiner looks the part of a caring but nosy woman.  Yet, not much about the honey-skinned blonde that supports one fact or another.
<br><br>
"You ready for this?," asked Radcliffe.  He checked the training paintball bullets loaded in the 120mm machinegun.  What's the use of hurting an ally?
<br><br>
"<i>Bring it on babe,</i>" came the reply.  With that a trail of paintball rounds raced towards Joiner's Zaku II C.  The female pilot gunned her engine to the limit and took off with Radcliffe in hot pursuit.
<br><br>
He watched the reticle in his cockpit as the former banker tried to line up his crosshairs with the elusive Zaku II C.  But after several minutes and more than half his ammo drum wasted later, Radcliffe had yet to nail the erratically flying Zaku II C.
<br><br>
"GAH!" he cried in frustration as Joiner jerked her mobile suit clear.
<br><br>
"Come on and fight me already!" he demanded.
<br><br>
"<i>Fine.</i>"
<br><br>
Radcliffe knew something was wrong when he heard the tone in her voice.  He realized too late that Joiner hadn't fired a single shot yet.
<br><br>
To Radcliffe's horror, Joiner's machinegun belched fire as live rounds flew towards him.  The anti-radiation plating beneath the Zaku II C's armor began to buckle as Radcliffe tried to fly his way out of the hailstorm of bullets.
<br><br>
"ARE YOU CRAZY?!" cried Radcliffe into his microphone," WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO, KILL ME?!"
<br><br>
"<i>Relax hon, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.</i>"
<br><br>
"You're crazy!"
<br><br>
In a desperate move to frighten Joiner off, Radcliffe open fire with his own machinegun.  But even though his rounds found their mark on Joiner's mobile suit, the  nonlethal paintball rounds only manage to upset Joiner's paint job.
<br><br>
Suddenly, Radcliffe's 120mm machinegun exploded in a cloud of sparks and shrapnel as a bullet find its mark.  The accountant clenched his teeth as his Zaku II C went into  a spin.  Then something grabbed him.  As his Zaku II C's monoeye swiveled, it locked onto Joiner's Zaku II C carrying him to safety and for repairs.

<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>Gangbang Guatemala</b></font></center>
<br><br>
Passing over the South American continent, a dish scans the mountains of Guatemala. As the atmospheric reconnaissance unit approaches the shoreline, the copilot is alerted of Zeon movement in the area.
<br><br> 
"We got two bogies at coordinates 14 10 N, 90 25 W." informed Boris.
<br><br> 
"Who do we have in that area?" asked  Priscila
<br><br> 
"Sensors are picking up an Armored GM. That's Private Saoirse's unit." replied Boris.
<br><br> 
 "Alert her immediately!" ordered Priscila
<br><br> 
"Private Saoirse, you've got two Dodais headed towards you. Proceed with caution, I repeat, proceed with caution."
<br><br> 
"Thanks for the heads up." replied Arianna as she smirked. "Call in air support."
<br><br> 
Meanwhile, Persephone Dawn was preparing to ambush her prey, unaware that her opponent was indeed expecting her company. As the Zaku Manipulator Arms type hovered above the Guatemalan fields and plantations, Dawn prepared her 2 MMP80s, and a Zaku machinegun for the upcoming battle. Alongside her, was her trusted sidekick, Sergeant Cortez in his spiffy Gouf. Both his unit and his skills as a pilot were something to be feared.
<br><br> 
As both Zeon pilots approached a clearing, away from the natives' farms, Diego spotted the GM S in the distance. Dawn quickly shoved Diego's Dodai to the side, narrowly avoiding a missile from a GM Bazooka. She then began to open fire at the lone GM S. Rounds of machinegun fire shook the earth beneath the GM S, as Arianna attempted to evade. 
<br><br> 
The superior thrusters of the GM S allowed Arianna to maneuver around fire, but she was still so inexperienced in comparison to her opponent. She was also outgunned, but she knew she only had to hold out for a couple more minutes. She hoped her reactive armor would be able to take the beating.
<br><br> 
As bullets tore through the Armored GM's body, it was evident that Dawn had already managed to predict her opponents moves after careful watch. Meanwhile in the deep blue ocean, three mobile suits anxiously waited for the right moment to strike.
<br><br> 
"She's going to get slaughtered. We should step in." commented Private Catalan.
<br><br> 
" Just a little bit longer, we are waiting for the right moment." ordered Hirsch Muncheck
<br><br> 
"Aalasyam amrutham visham" mentioned Private Pondicherry. 
<br><br> 
"And what the hell's that suppose to mean?" asked Hirch with traces of his New Yorker accent seeping through.
<br><br> 
"It translates to best chances will become odds if you don't react in time." replied Pondicherry.
<br><br> 
"Deep. Well then, air support should have arrived. Lets move out."
<br><br> 
"About time." said Pondicherry as he flexed his muscles, accidentally ripping his shirt. "Third one this week."
<br><br> 
Back at bay, Dawn spotted several aircrafts approaching their distance. 
<br><br> 
"It was a trap all along!" she alerted Diego, who only cursed. 
<br><br> 
"I'll handle this, finish off the GM so you can help me fend them off." she ordered, adjusting her Dodai to face the swarm of aircrafts.
<br><br> 
As three Jet Core Boosters spearhead Dawn, she opens fire at the approaching horde. Missiles firing and machineguns blaring, she takes out two of the core boosters. As Dawn is bombarded by enemy fire, several mantas soon rain down in balls of flame. One of the Dodai's engines are taken out, causing it to crash into the ground, but in the last second, Dawn catches herself.
<br><br> 
As Dawn struggles with the reinforcements, Diego continues to toy with the fallen GM S. Arianna was pinned down, as missile bombardment from the Dodai continued.
<br><br> 
Seeking to end it, Diego swoops down to finish Arianna off with his heat rod ready. Arianna attempts to intercept him with her beam saber, but is surprised to see her GM's arm torn off  right in front of her eyes. She retaliates with a round of her GM Bazooka, which Diego easily avoids.
<br><br> 
Diego is however surprised by his Dodai suddenly bursting into flames as he his overwhelmed by enemy fire. Diego manages to gain his balance after evacuating his Dodai. After picking himself up, three Federation Aquatic units stood in his view.
<br><br> 
"...and the Calvary arrives." pointed out Arianna
<br><br> 
Leading the charge, was Hirsch  in the waterproof Gundam. Instantaneously, they opened fire upon each other, similar to two cowboys in a western.  
<br><br> 
Diego managed to shift his Gouf to the right, having his shield take the impact of the shot. Hirsch followed the attack with a barrage of micromissiles, which wore down the Gouf's high tensile steel plating. 
<br><br> 
Private Pondicherry and Catalan took advantage of their numbers, flanking the lone Gouf. Both pilots empty a round of their waterproof GM Machineguns into the Gouf's chest and within seconds, the unit is reduced to scrap metal after an explosion after Hirsch assists
<br><br> 
"You alright Private Saoirse?" asked Hirsch.
<br><br> 
"Yeah. I can't say the same about my GM." replied Arianna as she picked up the severed limb with her remaining arm.
<br><br> 
After continuous air-to-surface fire, the Zaku Manipulator Arms type is downed. The manipulator arms are destroyed or severed after repeated dive bombing from the remaining Jet Core Booster and the Fly Mantas backing it up.
<br><br> 
When the coast is clear, Dawn manages to escape. In the midst of the chaos, she escapes, taking refuge amongst fleeing farmers. She manages to blend in due to her refusal to wear a Zeon uniform.
<br><br> 
"I will avenge you Diego, I promise." she muttered under her breath.
<br><br>
