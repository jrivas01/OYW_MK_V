<br>
Sweat began to coalesce on the young man's forhead as he shivered inside his cockpit; lack of sleep, drugs, and that damned voice had driven Alain to an unstable state and it was beginning to show physically. The wannabe newtype had bags under his eyes, his skin was pale, and he looked like he hadn't eaten in some time, but he pressed on; he wasn't about to let some crazy bitch break him, and he needed to prove himself.
<br><br>
So many things had come to irritate Alain lately, and with each passing day his desire to tolerate such 'trivial' things dwindled, especially these two pilots that had been assigned to him; He didn't need them. He stared silently into the vast expanse of white that covered his display monitors, nothing could be seen amongst the tundra aside from an occasional tree. After a few minutes his body began to twitch slightly, a small jerking of his right leg, and a fidget of his fingers; something his body couldn't control. 
<br><br>
"FUCK THIS!" Alain erupted, slamming his unsteady fist into the control panel in front of him. It had been far too long since his last battle, and now he couldn't navigate his way through the wretched wilderness of this horrible planet to rendevouz with the Terrestrial Assault fleet. The disgruntled pilot shouldered his mobile suit's shotgun, turned and ordered the two flunkies that had been following him to stay put. "I'll be back... I need to be alone."
<br><br>

<br><br>
<i>Beep...beep..beep.beepbeepbeep</i>
<br><br>
Aaron's targeting computer locked in on his target in the distance, as the motors buzzed to life, readjusting the GM's railcannon carefully. The Federation officer smiled in anticipation as the giant weapon folded over its shoulder and began to crackle with magnetic energy. In the distance, the G-force fleet was en route to Archangelisk where it was set to resupply and prepare for its next mission; but Mccaskey had other plans.
<br><br>
"Like shooting fish in a barrel." He mused to himself as the display began to blink, informing the pilot that the railgun was charged and ready to fire. With out giving it much of a second thought, the Officer squeezed the trigger, and in a flash, an artillery round was launched clear across the vast tundra, hurtling at great speed towards the fleet.  
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br><br>
<b>BOOM</b>
<br><br>
Alain could feel the shock wave in his chest as snow fell from the trees all around him, creating a cloud of white mist as the blue mobile suit trekked slowly through the woods. The Efreet came to a complete stop as the pilot felt sick to his stomach; the concussive blast made him want to hurl. After the feeling subsided he looked up to see just ahead of him, in a clearing what appeared to be a Federation artillery suit.
<br><br>
<font size=1><b>Kill me...</b></font>
<br><br>
The exhausted pilot rubbed his eyes lazily as he looked back to the mobile suit just a head of him. His vision began to blur and what he could have sworn had been a basic GM now appeared to him as the Federation's Blue Devil; how he hated that wretched suit. Alain began to almost growl as he muttered incoherently to himself. Sweat began to fall down the side of his temple as he gripped the controls, his clammy hands slipping, causing him to grip tighter. What should he do, the suit was all alone, it was the perfect opportunity to rid himself of this imposter.
<br><br>
<font size=2><b>Kill me...</b></font>
<br><br>
He grabbed his head, almost pulling his hair out as he tried to concentrate on the situation at hand. The weary pilot had grown tired of this girls constant harping and desire of death. <i>"Kill me"</i> was the only phrase she knew, or at least he was convinced of that, and it drove him crazy. Couldn't she see he was preoccupied at the moment? Alain began to shake from the stress.
<br><br>
"Shut up you fucking selfish whore! Get out of my head!"
<br><br>
He snapped. Drawing his shotgun and a heat saber, Alain charged towards the other one. The blue Efreet came crashing through the forest, leveling its wrist mounted grenade launcher and littering the perimeter around the federation suit with smoke grenades. 
<br><br>
"What the hell?" Aaron could see smoke appearing in his monitors as he was targeting his next shot. His first attempt only netted him a single tank, and the fleet had begun to scatter; he had hoped to get off a second shot on one of the ships. Unfortunately for him it seemed he had an univited guest. As the Federation officer began to turn around to see what was happening he could feel the earth begin to tremble from the frantic steps of the Efreet as it closed in on him. "Oh shit..."
<br><br> 
As soon as he turned to face the suit, he saw the Efreet launch into the air, barrel of its fun pointed straight at him, and heat saber drawn above its head. Screaming at the top of his lungs, and shaking profusely from the adrenaline, Alain pulled the trigger and the tip of his shot gun burst to life as he shot the GM LCT in the chest. Luckily for Aaron, his Luna Titanium armor absorbed most of the damage, but the concusive blast knocked him off balance. With out hesitation he ignited his beam saber in a flash of bright pink energy, bringing it in front of his suit just in time to block the over head slash of the crazed blue monster. 
<br><br>
<font size=2><b>KILL ME...</b></font>
<br><br>
"NO!" He grunted as his attack was repelled, sending the Efreet stumbling backwards. In all the chaos Alain struggled to fight, his fever had intensified and his vision was beginning to blur again. The broken man brought the suit's heat saber up for another strike, but was easily blocked again by the startled GM. Before he could protest anymore he lost consciousness, his body finally giving up where his will would not. For a moment, the Efreet seemed to go lifeless as it sat still, creating a break in the storm.
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
Before Aaron could capitalize or think what to make of the sudden pause, the mono-eye lit back to life, glowing a deeper red than before. Its joints seemed to creak to life as it seemed to go into a controlled seizure. The GM began to step away and in a flash the Efreet launched itself at the Federation suit in a new found frenzy. The blue suit slashed fervently at the mobile suit, and the Federation pilot was barely able to keep up its blocks with its beam saber, giving up more and more ground as he back pedaled. In one of its violent strokes, the heat saber managed to clip the hand of the GM LCT, sending it and the beam saber lifelessly to the ground.
<br><br> 
<font size=4><b>KILL ME!</b></font>
<br><br> 
The possessed suit used its thrusters to jump into the air, stuffing its shotgun barrel into its head, and blowing it clean off, causing the suit to stumble backwords. As it descended the Efreet planted its feet into the GM's chest, and rode it to the ground with a thunderous crash. As a cloud of powdered snow floated into the air all around them, the Efreet brandished its heat saber and raised it above its head and came crashing down on its right shoulder, slicing right down the side, just missing the cockpit. In a panic, Aaron grabbed his beam spray gun with the GM's one good hand and fired up at the menacing suit, destroying the arm that was holding the sword. 
<br><br>
<font size=4><b>KILL ME!</b></font>
<br><br>
The Efreet stumbled back a little but quickly lurched forward, taking the shot gun and bashing down mindlessly against the Federation suit. Again, Aaron leveled the gun at the Efreet, but this time Marion reacted, grabbing the arm and ripping it clean from the suit. The Efreet's Mono eye seemed to pulse brighter as she began bashing her enemy with its arm. Sparks flew and fires began to start as Marion pummeled the downed federation suit into nothing with its bare hands and her make shift club.
<br><br>
Aaron began saying his prayers and making his peace with God, it no longer looked like he would live. As he was all but ready to give up, he figured he'd take one last shot at attempting to save himself. Taking a deep breath the federation pilot hit full throttle on his jump jets and the thrusters on its feet ignited, jolting the suit forward across the ground. The sudden shift caused the Efreet to lose its balance in the middle of its throes of fury. The Blue mobile suit crashed into the snow with a resounding thud, and just like that the chaos had ceased. 
<br><br>
Inside his cockpit Aaron was bleeding from the head, and felt like he had broken a few ribs, but was happy to be alive. He knew it was by pure luck, but would not complain. After his adrenaline had worn off, the battered pilot collapsed in his seat and passed out.

<br>
Sand kicked up around the feet of her Zaku C as Aleena slowly approached the Federation big tray, in the North African desert. Her suits radio crackled to life with a Federation officer demanding that she identify herself. "My name is Aleena Andriele, I'm with the African Union." was her response.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Nigel walked across the bridge of his new Big Tray the Hood. He was still slightly thrown off about the size of the bridge compared to his old Medea. "Did she say she's with the African Union?" he asked coming up behind his friend Kyle who was currently talking to the pilot. Kyle glanced back and nodded at Nigel. "Says she'd like to tag along with us into Zeon territory." Nigel considered this for a moment. "Tell her she can tag a long til we at least cross into their territory." Kyle nodded. The EFGF had decent relations with the AU before. It seemed foolish to turn down their help now. With that the AU's mobile suit, and the EF's big tray began pushing their way into North Africa.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Deeper into North Africa, four ms were currently flying across the desolate landscape. Four Zeon Zaku II D's  The "Pink Panthers" were flying across the ground on their jet skis doing their routine patrol. The lead Zaku's head turned slightly, as its cameras picked up a large dust trail off in the distance. Almost as one the entire patrol shifted to a new heading. They were now heading towards the area the dust trail was coming from.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Alarms sounded across the Bridge of the Hood, and Nigel glanced up from the report he was reading. "Status" he asked and he stood up out of the captains chair. "Dish is reporting four solid contacts heading right for us." someone called out. Nigel turned towards Kyle. "Scramble, all units to engage. And let our AU guest know as well." Kyle nodded and Nigel tuned away walking towards one of the Hood's many windows. To him it felt like he could already see the enemy approaching in the distance.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The Hood burst into activity as planes took off from it, and mobile suits disembarked. Tin Cod's and Fly Manta's formed up and stood ready to engage the enemy, while the EF's two GM's kept themselves near Aleena's Zaku. Just as the last fighter cleared the deck of the Hood. Four Zaku's appeared on the horizon, angling straight towards the Big tray. The Tin Cod's and Fly Manta's immediately rushed to meet the Zaku's charge. Vulcan fire, machine gun rounds, missiles, and bombs we're traded between the wo opposing groups as the planes swarmed over the Zaku's attempting to keep them away from the Big tray.
<br><br>
But the Pink Panthers would have none of that. They weaved through most of the fire, downing Tin Cod's and Fly Mantas as they went. It seemed like they'd break through the opening attack unscathed until a lucky pair of missiles punched into the trailing Zaku's ski's sending it cart wheeling across the desert at high speeds. But the other three sped on regardless, two breaking off to engage the ms forces, and one heading for the Hood before the fighters could regroup.
<br><br>
Aleena and the Federation GM's opened fire, beam fire an machine gun rounds flashed toward the two approaching Zaku's. Machine fire raced back towards them in response. Aleena kept her cool and focused her fire on the trailing Zaku. Her rounds flashed into the ground all around it before multiple impacts struck it's legs and lower torso. The zaku kept coming towards them for a few seconds before pitching over and off it's skis. Seconds later minor explosions ripped its torso apart. The lead zaku kept on coming though, and pull a bazooka around from it's back. It fired three rounds towards them. The first went wide, but the second two slammed straight into the GM next to her. Aleena was rocked in her cockpit as the GM  on her right exploded next to her.  The remaining GM kept firing though, it's beam spray gun blazed and two rounds punched into the Zaku. One into it's right arm, and the other into it's left leg, tearing it off. The Zaku came off it's skis and flipped across the ground like it's previous brethren. Except this time it collided with the still reeling Aleena. Her Zaku C was thrown across the ground bouncing three times before coming to a rest. It's left arm was completely crushed and it's right leg missing.
<br><br>
The fight wasn't over however as the last of te Pink Panthers threw itself towards the Hood, it's bazooka barked as it fired round after round. Most impacted on the Big Trays frontal armor, doing little to no damage. Only one lucky shot managed to clip the front of it's hover bed causing the Hood to lurch slightly forward. As if angered by this turn of events. The Hood's Fore MPC's fired, The lone Zaku never stood and chance and vanished in the beam of light.
<br><br>

<br>
"What's the Damage?" Nigel asked, and Kyle approched him and handed him a list. "We lost some fighters and one mobile suit. Are AU friend got quite busted up. Thankfully the Big Tray held up well and took only Light damage to the front." Nigel took it all in with a nod." Bring our forces back aboard and see to our ally."
