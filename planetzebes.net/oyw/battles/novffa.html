<br>
The near future. Mankind stumbled upon what seemed the eternal secret: A method of harnessing super robot spirit. However, no one knew this was the event which would eventually lead to armageddon. The moon was occupied in a split second by the sudden attack of the Guests. Soon, they threatened the Earth itself. So mankind developed state-of-the-art technologies under the command of the United Nations Security Council, including a new weapon, the Super Robots, to stop the invasion. Using the Super Robots power, mankind exterminated the furious Guests during the ten years of the Moon War. However...
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Time has past, and the death of Super Robot pioneer Dr. Ferdinand will reveal the true intentions of the Invaders. It is a stormy night, and amidst the thunder a black figure, round shaped with two long and skinny arms, watches a church in the distance...
<br><br>
Elsewhere, two old friends are driving along a secluded highway, moving to a secure location in the mountains. The thunder roars, rain pattering on their trucks as they relive their nostalgia.
<br><br>
"Do you really think he killed Dr. Ferdinand." Isaiah said, driving the truck. Vash becomes angry, knocking the pictures out of his hands.
<br><br>
"I thought Dr. Ferdinand died in a plane crash?" Vash said, confused.
<br><br>
"No no, you're thinking of the wrong guy. Anyways, we're here." Isaiah responded. The two pulled up to an evil looking mansion, lit with candles. Inside a shaded figure of Lukas was talking to a chick with a mask on a motorcycle.
<br><br>
"rlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrl, I'm supposed to be Hayato! Crazy talk, crazy talk, rlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrl! Murloc noises!" Lukas said, Des responding.
<br><br>
"Having boobs is pretty cool. By the way, I can bring the dead back to life!" He said, and started to cackle. Suddenly an evil looking tiger poked its eye through the window.
<br><br>
"Koouki?! What is a Guest doing here!" Des was shocked. Suddenly Koouki burst into the mansion, tearing apart the vintage victorian furniture. Isaiah and Vash picked rifles out of nowhere and began firing, with no effect. The rain pattered hard, Solid in the Huckebien rushing from the dark to defeat Koouki.
<br><br>
"Black Hole Cannon!" Solid yelled, the Huckebien lighting up. Des ignored his boobs for a moment to yell a warning.
<br><br>
"You must not harm the cargo!" He yelled. Koouki roared, slicing through Des before destroying the confused Huckebien. Isaiah and Vash quickly finished loading the cargo in their truck and began to drive off. Out of the corner of their eye they saw Maxter battling the Guest.
<br><br>
"What is that doing here?!" Isaiah said, also wondering why he and Vash were so fat if they were supposed to be badasses. The thunder flashed again, showing another Guest rushing after them. This time it was the Big O, hidden in the darkness because it is dark.
<br><br>
Vash picked a missile launcher out of the back seat and stuck himself out the window, shooting at Big O. It had no effect. Big O jumped on top of the truck and began to sing Queen songs, scaring them greatly.
<br><br>
"What are we supposed to do?!" Vash howled. The missile launcher was doing no damage. Suddenly Isaiah let go of the wheel, climbing into the back compartment while the truck apparently drove itself on a winding road for several seconds.
<br><br>
"Vash, take the wheel! I'll deal with him!"
<br><br>
"Right!" Vash yelled, ditching the missile launcher and getting back in the truck, while he drove, Boss Borot broke out of the truck, punching Big O in the face. Big O punched back, the two having a boxing match atop the winding road.
<br><br>
"Kkh, I'll defeat you!" Isaiah yelled. "DAISETSUSAN ORO-" he was cut short. A single cannon shell ripped through the Big O, the mecha exploding and taking out half the mountain but strangely not damaging the truck at all. In the next moment a Ball shaped object flew by, swiping the sensitive cargo container. It only took a moment, but Isaiah thought he saw out of the corner of his mine a Tekkaman inside the container...
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
The next day, the military was in an uproar. Loaded with tons of the best possible super robots, the SDF-1 and Macross 7 were launching for Balltome labs in southern Japan. On the bridge of each ship respectively, Rei Ayanami and an annoying kid from back east made their battle strategy.
<br><br>
"..." Rei Ayanami said.
<br><br>
"Yes! With heat hawks and like twenty RP at level zero!" Draco responded.
<br><br>
"Enemy is confirmed! It's a bunch of super robots!" They were interrupted by some guy.
<br><br>
"Right! Launch all veritechs, mobile suits, arbalests, gespensts, weird crazy samurai mechs riding horses and OG units!" Draco said, waving a hand in the air amazingly. He pictured himself drawing a comic about this later.
<br><br>
"..." Rei Ayanami responded. Tian began to regret his character idea.
<br><br>
"Yes I know! Why is nobody in the Giant Robo!" Draco said, dramatically. While they argued a zillion robots began launching from the two super dimensional fortresses.
<br><br>
"..." answered Rei.
<br><br>
"They're letting HIM pilot it again?! But he is an A-class criminal! Believe it!" Draco said, aghast. Their conversation was cut short as missiles exploded into the side of the Macross 7, damaging it greatly. The enemy forces had arrived. Balltomes defenses were made up of Excellion, Gunbuster, Bamburian, Mugen Liger, Voltron, Nobel, Epyon, GaoGaiGar, Godannar, Ideon, Aquarion and Peirines. Nobody knew what Peirines was or what it did really, so it kind of fell over and died, but at least Chesley was mentioned!
<br><br>
Suddenly, dramatic <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot-0-KyPd0Y" target=new><u>music</u></a> began to play.
<br><br>
"I AM THE SWORD OF MAGUS!" James yelled, Aussenseiter and Daizengar charging out of the bowels of the SDF-1. They rushed through the hordes of enemies, Bamburian moving to face them. It roared a hamster roar, James roaring back and picking up his zankantou. The sword became huge, Dyriks glasses flashing as James slashed straight through the mechanical hamster.
<br><br>
"TATSUMAKI ZANKANTOU! THERE ARE NONE BEFORE ME WHO HAVE NOT BEEN CLEAVED!" James continued to yell, Bamburian exploding behind him. For dramatic effect the sun immediately set, Dyriks glasses flashing again, but then the sun rose again because it was supposed to be daytime.
<br><br>
"..." Rei replied, the SDF-1 moving to engage the Excellion. Macross 7 continued in a covering position, pinpoint barriers activated and the group firing a zillion missiles. However, Gunbuster landed on top of the ship, Dan wearing a form fitting jumpsuit.
<br><br>
"TROLL BARRIAAAAAAAAAAH!" he yelled, the Gunbuster whipping out a cloak and blocking the attack.
<br><br>
"TROLL HOMING LASER!" Dan responded, firing lasers into the Macross 7. Draco cursed, the ship exploding outright. On the ground, numerous robots faced each other. Veritechs zoomed around, automatically fighting better because music was playing, even though it was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot-0-KyPd0Y" target=new><u>Trombe!</u></a> Missiles of all sorts were fired, but then GaoGaiGar smashed Drewsies Armored Valkyrie with a hammer.
<br><br>
"FINAL FUUUUUUUUUUUSIO-" Kyle said, but James ran him through with a sword as well. The SDF-1 began to transform, Rei becoming angry and stuff.
<br><br>
"..." She said, the fortress going into an attack as the Excellion peppered it with missiles.
<br><br>
"We must protect the SDF-1 while it prepares its Deadalus Attack!" Dyrik said, his glasses flashing. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot-0-KyPd0Y" target=new><u>Trombe!</u></a> became louder, the valkyries unloading even more missiles, destroying Mugen Liger and the Nobel, because nobody wanted to see Altoh piloting that. Gunbuster leapt off the Excellion, even as the SDF-1 rammed its massive fist into its core.
<br><br>
"SUPAH TROLL KIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK!" Dan yelled, Gunbuster coming down on the SDF-1. There was a massive explosion, the combined force of the Deadalus Attack and the Super Troll Kick annhialating the SDF-1, Excellion and Gunbuster all together. However, the veritechs were still doing very well, thanks to the musical inspiration of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot-0-KyPd0Y" target=new><u>Trombe!</u></a>
<br><br>
But then Ideon stepped on Daizengar and Aussenseiter, destroying them. At this point the battle began to go poorly for the governments forces. Ideon pulled out a really big gun, Kuriboh trying to look cool as said gun obliterated Ravage in the Nightmare, Strikey in the FAST PACK Valkyrie and Zero in the Mark Sein. Cid appeared out of the explosion, the Tallgeese 3 taking forever to charge its cannon. For a moment, Cid wondered why it took so long to charge a military gun. He fired at Godannar, but Chan dodged, his map clearly indicating that the attack would come from such a direction.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, amidst the safety of the UN Security Council Secret Briefing Room, the military elite of the world was watching the battle. Then, for some reason, the screen was hacked and it shifted to an evil looking Ball with a goatee, floating atop Balltome labs.
<br><br>
"Gasp! Dr. Ferdinand!" One of the generals said, Dr. Ferdinand cackling.
<br><br>
"And you look just like Dr. Hell!" Another guy said. The group gasped again as the camera zoomed in to a capsule behind Dr. Ferdinand, clearly showing the silhouette of Tekkaman Dead.
<br><br>
"You didn't complete it?!" a third general responded. Dr. Ferdinand cackled again. The screen was reduced to static.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, back at the battle, the military forces were being overrun. Aquarion did a long range punch, destroying the Tallgeese 3, while Anastasia in the Arbalest fought valiantly against Epyon. However, Epyon is pretty awesome, and Feyd sliced Anastasia in two with his beam sword, killing Xander in the Gespenst and Arcaile in the Grunganst Type 0 shortly after. Only the Zeta Gundam and Alteisen Reise remained on the government forces.
<br><br>
"We must retreat!" Bigby shouted, the Reise trying to run away even as Scarth descended upon him, Voltron kicking his unit into a mountain. Blackmage was busy raping somebody or eating somebody or generally just being gross to get a reaction, and was oblivious when Balltome's troops descended upon him.
<br><br>
With all their forces destroyed, the generals at the UN became worried.
<br><br>
"It's all up to him now..." One of them said, gulping hard.
<br><br>
"I still can't believe we're giving that man the chance to kill him twice..." Another responded. Suddenly a door opened at the back of the room, a medium sized teddy bear and a blazing hot android chick walking into the room.
<br><br>
"You came?!" One of the generals asked. The two laughed in a sinister way.
<br><br>
"Of course! This is our chance to witness what will happen. Isn't that right, Bonta-Kun?" KOS MOS asked, grinning and looking at her partner.
<br><br>
"Yes indeed, KOS MOS-Kun" Bonta-Kun responded with a similar grin. KOS MOS was angry.
<br><br>
"WTF Kun mate." she said.
<br><br>
"Can it Latooni, everyone knows you're a dude." Aurem answered.
<br><br>
"But... Tylatz got to be a chick." KOS MOS sighed.
<br><br>
The generals coughed loudly trying to get their attention. The two snapped out of it, going back to their sinister grins.
<br><br>
At the battlefield, all seemed lost, Dr. Ferdinand giving a speech that seemed strangely scripted.
<br><br>
"We have to pay for our deeds, yes! Foolish people who tried to trifle with Super Robot Spirit as a source of infinite energy, without trying to know its true nature! Come, confess your sins to the last dawn of the world! Ahahahahahahahaha!"
<br><br>
"Shut up! Take your own advice!" Yelled Andrew, the Giant Robo flying out of the sky and landing in front of Balltome's forces.
<br><br>
"Andrew?!" Dr. Ferdinand said, aghast.
<br><br>
"Long time no see, Gramps! I don't know how you were brought to life again, but I'll make sure of your end this time!" Giant Robo charged forward, punching Godannar in the face, which exploded.
<br><br>
"Stop it!" Dr. Ferdinand yelled, sitting in a chair that was next to him for no real reason other than to look evil. Nobody thought to ask how a Ball could sit in a chair.
<br><br>
"For your own sake, don't continue this! But first I have to praise you for having come all this way here! You betrayer!"
<br><br>
"Shut up!" Andrew responded. "I haven't forgotten what you were plotting to do with Super Robot Spirit! Besides, you have to die anyway! In that case, I'll kill you with my hands this time!" Giant Robo posed, looking incredibly awesome and cool, and for added measure Andrew put on a big red scarf.
<br><br>
"Did you say the same thing when Vlad left?" Dr. Ferdinand responded, his robots springing into action. Giant Robo charged them, Andrew grabbing Epyon with his scarf and holding it still while the Robo punched and destroyed it. He battled with Aquarion next, Advocates agile mecha barely able to save him from Giant Robos awesome punch. Aquarion leapt back, but Giant Robo had other plans.
<br><br>
"Robo Beam!" Andrew yelled, Giant Robo shooting a laser that destroyed Aquarion. Only Ideon and Voltron remained.
<br><br>
"As expected of the Super Robot leader. However!" Dr. Ferdinand howled. Voltron split into its consecutive pieces, Scarth programming the five lions to hold Giant Robo down. Kuriboh posed again, Ideon pulling out its really huge gun and aiming for Andrew and the Giant Robo.
<br><br>
"OPEN ROBO!" Andrew yelled even as Ideon fired, the blast destroying both it at Voltron. Giant Robo escaped, sailing above the air and coming down on Balltome labs. He punched for Dr. Ferdinand, but in that moment Tekkaman Dead burst out of the capsule, blocking the punch.
<br><br>
"What?!" Andrew howled, Chris throwing Giant Robo backwards and into the dirt.
<br><br>
"Hahaha! You are too late! I shall take my revenge for the loss of Vlad!" Dr. Balltome howled. Chris walked to the edge of Balltome labs, standing proud and tall.
<br><br>
"CHAAAAAAAANGE MAZINKAISAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
<br><br>
Suddenly all of Balltome's destroyed robots began to break apart, their segments 
coming together atop of Balltome labs.
<br><br>
Back at the UN headquarters, the generals, KOS MOS and Bonta-Kun were surprised.
<br><br>
"What glorious Super Robot Spirit!" one of the generals said. KOS MOS responded.
<br><br>
"Yes. The ultimate Super Robot, that no one dared take for the FFA. Dr. Ferdinand is truly brilliant." She continued her evil grin.
<br><br>
"But do not worry, you have us on your side. Isn't that right, KOS MOS-Kun." Aurem responded, grinning evilly.
<br><br>
"Yes that's right, Bonta-Kun." KOS MOS answered, grinning.
<br><br>
Andrew picked himself up, the Giant Robo slowly beginning to stand. The sky was filled with machine parts, slowly turning into the deadly Mazinkaiser.
<br><br>
"If I can destroy them while they are transforming..." Andrew said, trying to ignore his grievous wounds. He stood up when a cannon shell smashed into his suit, knocking it back down. Dr. Ferdinand and his Ball-like form were between him and Chris.
<br><br>
"I will not let you harm my dear Chris like you did Vlad!" Dr. Ferdinand said again. Andrew cried out as the cannon shot again, knocking Giant Robo backwards. But all of a sudden Maxter burst out of the ground, punching the Ball away.
<br><br>
"Grr, you! I will not let you stop me!" Dr. Ferdinand said, firing the cannon into Maxter. However, Boss Borot and SRX appeared behind him, punching the Ball and knocking it away.
<br><br>
"SRX? Maxter?! Boss Borot!! Then they must be!" Andrew exclaimed. Inside the three machines Lukas, Vash and Isaiah faced their enemy.
<br><br>
"We will not let you form Mazinkaiser!" the lot of them said.
<br><br>
"The entire Super Robot Team? Well, you are too late! The combination is already complete! Ahahahahahahahaha~!" Dr. Ferdinand howled, even as the four pilots crushed him utterly.
<br><br>
Back at the UN headquarters, a consensus had been reached. The only way to destroy Mazinkaiser was to fire a missile at it capable of destroying all of Japan. Only then could the menace be stopped.
<br><br>
"Mmm... Riding that missile would look really cool. Don't you agree, KOS MOS-Kun?" Bonta-Kun took a few steps into the middle of the room.
<br><br>
"Yes, I believe it is time Bonta-Kun." KOS MOS responded. The two of them whipped out big giant gatling guns and pointed them at the generals.
<br><br>
"What are you doing?!" The generals gasped, KOS MOS and Bonta-Kun gunning them down.
<br><br>
"We are those who coexist with Super Robot Spirit! We are the Guests!" The two laughed, killing the UN Security Council. Rushing to the missile silo, they climbed atop it and rode it as it shot into orbit, heading for Japan. They didn't stop laughing until they saw Mazinkaiser in their midst, Giant Robo, SRX, Boss Borot and Maxter chasing behind it.
<br><br>
"What?! This wasn't supposed to happen!" Bonta-Kun howled, leaping off of the missile.
<br><br>
"We must summon our Guest army!" KOS MOS responded. The two moved away quickly. The Guest army appeared behind them, warping in from subspace and surrounding their masters. Amongst them was Eva 01, Eva 00, the AGX Flower, Vermillion, Cybuster, Escaflowne, RahXephon, Astranagant, Turn A, DaiRaiOh, Big Fau, Dunbine, Nirvash Type Zero and the Black Selena.
<br><br>
"This was what Dr. Ferdinand planned all along! Now, witness something with more Super Robot Spirit than Mazinkaiser! BREASTO FIAAAAAAAAAAA!" Chris yelled, Tekkaman Dead on the shoulder of the Mazinkaiser. Mazinkaiser let out its ultimate attack, destroying the missile. The combined force of the two attacks colliding caused a fracture in space-time, which opened up into a massive corridoor, visible Super Robot Spirit billowing out of it. Out of the gateway appeared a long and dangerous looking Jukon, Shin Getter Robo, Black Getter and a GM Sniper riding it. Gaplant, Jim, Ryocha and Laurent Auclair grinned, their eyes blazing with an awesome fire.
<br><br>
"J-J-J-JUKON EMPEROR?!" Bonta-Kun stammered, aghast at the Guests ultimate foe.
<br><br>
"BEHOLD THE JUKON SIX, JUKON EMPEROR!" Gaplant roared, Shin Getter leaping off of the giant submarine. Black Getter and Giant Robo flanked him, charging head first into the Guests.
<br><br>
"TOMAHAWK BOOMERANG!" Gaplant yelled, flinging his tomahawk straight through Dunbine. Turn A charged, Marcus striking at Shin Getter and pushing him back.
<br><br>
"No one is allowed to kill Ketara but me!" He cried, teleporting into the Getter teams midst. He appeared behind Boss Borot, slicing Isaiah in two with a beam saber. Jim responded, the GM Sniper destroying Turn A with its long range beam rifle.
<br><br>
"Haha!" Jim exclaimed. However, Cybuster pulled a giant rubix cube out of subspace, destroying the GM Sniper with it.
<br><br>
"Nooo, Soyoung Joun~" Jim cried as he was killed. The Getter team was losing men fast, it had to do something. Charging in, Mazinkaiser slashed wildly, taking out Eva 01 and the Nirvash and moving into the middle of the group. Bonta-Kun responded, punching Mazinkaiser and sending it falling back to Earth. Chris jumped off of his mecha at the last moment, Tekkaman cutting Bonta-Kun in twain.
<br><br>
"Noooo!" KOS MOS responded, pulling out a sword and charging Chris. The two engaged in an impressive duel, the robots around them fighting a deadly battle. Black Getter charged, Ryocha assaulting the Black Selena. The two black super robots were black, and therefor nobody could see what they were doing. Later, both exploded for unknown reasons.
<br><br>
"No! Ribbons!" Gaplant cried, rushing into the Guests. "GETTA BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAMU!" He fired his beam, but the Guests dodged. They ignored Shin Getter, moving straight for the Jukon Emperor. Big Fau, DaiRaiOh and Astranagant landed on the Jukon, using their impressive weaponry to tear it apart.
<br><br>
"What?! They're destroying the Jukon Emperor before it can deliver the Big Bang!" Gaplant responded. Chris emerged, having defeated KOS MOS and flanking Shin Getter.
<br><br>
"With Mazinkaiser defeated only you can initiate the Big Bang! Use the Stoner Sunshine!" Chris cried. In the next moment he was swallowed by Eva 00, even though it has no mouth. Thomas roared about how this looked way too much like Dr. Strangelove with goofy villains riding missiles, and charged Gaplant. Shin Getter was knocked back, Andrew and the Giant Robo coming to his aid. He punched Thomas away, but was beaten back when Escaflowne and Cybuster attacked him.
<br><br>
"Damn Guests! I shall defeat you!" Andrew exclaimed, shooting both of Giant Robos big giant missiles at the two. Escaflowne and Cybuster exploded, SRX and Master appearing out of the inferno. There were few foes left, however, the most homosexual Guest of all was still to be beaten. Standing before them, RahXephon looked incredibly girly, the wings on its head coming to life as Aleksei opened his mouth.
<br><br>
"COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOCKS" Aleksei hummed, the blast wave from RahXephon destroying Lukas in the Maxter. SRX barely got away, Vash coming around Aleksei's flank and punching straight through RahXephons ass. Aleksei was killed, but he loved the way it happened.
<br><br>
"Now, the Stoner Sunshine!" Andrew and Vash exclaimed. Shin Getter raised its arms above its head, Gaplant forming the Stoner Sunshine. However, out of the darkness the AGX Flower attacked, the giant warship shooting lasers into the crowd. Jukon Emperor responded, Laurent firing his Jukon Beam into the Flower and destroying it. But Shin Getter was destroyed as well, the fledgeling Stoner Sunshines energy starting to dissipate. DaiRaiOh, Astranagant and Big Fau continued eating away at the Jukon Emperor.
<br><br>
"No!" Andrew exclaimed. He rushed forward, grabbing the Stoner Sunshine while Vash in the SRX covered him. The Vermillion charged forward, Janadian firing its big cannon thing. But the SRX took the shot, because it's pretty awesome, and Vash fired some T-Link megagun, destroying the Vermillion.
<br><br>
"Now! The Stoner Sunshine!" Vash cried, oblivious to the fact that he'd said this exact same line two paragraphs earlier.
<br><br>
"Right! STONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE!" Andrew cried, throwing the ball into the Jukon Emperor. It struck, Laurent giving a thumbs up as the ship exploded, initiating the Big Bang and destroying the universe. The amazing Guests were destroyed immediately, Thomas shielding himself with the AT field and barely surviving the attack. In order to save Andrew, Vash valiantly shielded the Giant Robo with the SRX.
<br><br>
"MUSASHIIIIIIIIIIIII I mean VAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH!" Andrew cried. Suddenly only he and Thomas were left. The two stared at each other evilly.
<br><br>
"You know, I really don't like fighting. Can we have a rap battle? Tell jokes? Make obscure movie and literature references to show how cultured we are?" Thomas said, the Eva 00 severely damaged by the Big Bang.
<br><br>
"Yeah, I can do that." Andrew responded. Suddenly however, the Eva 00 powered down, its five minute charge up.
<br><br>
"Or I can punch you in the face!" Andrew responded, Giant Robo charging forward and beheading the Evangelion with its fist.
