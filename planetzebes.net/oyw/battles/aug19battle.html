<br>
Pink beams coursed through space, chasing after the four armed Zaku Manipulator. Persephone pressed the throttle faster and faster, trying to get away from her pursuer - but as the old saying goes, "Run from a sniper, die tired." Finally, a beam hit the mark, shearing off an arm and sending it into space. 
<br><br>
The arm passed Dagobert Lavanche, but did not distract him. His mobile suit was doing its best to match speed - but unlike Persephone he was calm, collected. Dignified. The Lousiana aristocrat took aim at another shot, looking for that ever-elusive kill. Instead, between the flailing arms of the manipulator, he looked directly into the bridge of a Musai. A captain waved his arm, and soon the battle was reversed; a 6-shot barrage of meta particle fire headed his way. Dagobert broke off, having to let his prey run to its den - but was not as unprepared as Persephone would hope. 
<br><br>
"Rear Admiral, fall back! We'll cover your escape!"
<br><br>
"Ne'er you mind, Commander. Let's sink 'em and be done with it."
<br><br>
Two <i>Salamis</i> came into view, their mega particle weapons forming a brilliant display of pink on yellow. The Musai class <i>Vigilance</i> was scorched, while a Salamis took the barrage head on. The yellow beams cut through the ship, striking the bridge of one and sending an explosion through it. The Salamis turned harshly, having lost control, and then idled.
<br><br>
"Not as clean as I'd prefer.." Dagobert quipped, ducking behind the Salamis to use as a firing platform. The other engaged the Musai as well, hitting the ship again. The <i>Vigilance</i> was damaged, but not sunk - and started to attempt to retreat. Its captain, Commodore Clancy Breen, held her head in her hands, party to a head wound. Dagobert found this a prime opportunity to scratch off one ship from Zeon's registry.. but his target was much more valuable. He scanned the area for the Zaku. Where could it have gone? A GM Command appeared. That's odd. He was unaware of another mobile suit pilot in this area.
<br><br>
His wanderings were quickly answered, as fire erupted around him. The Salamis was being engaged by a Gelgoog and two Zaku.. one bearing three arms! Before he could swing his rifle around for his primary target, the Command attacked him as well! Haifa Hahnemuehle fired a grenade from her MMP-80 90mm machinegun, trailing it with machine gun fire and catching Dagobert by surprise. His sniper rifle exploded, sending pink particles in all directions, and he soon found himself unarmed. A giant explosion rocked him, as the Salamis was destroyed by the Gelgoog and Zaku. The four mobile suits approached, and Dagobert was at wit's end. He still had three grenades equipped.. but instantly, he put that thought out of his head. He was a dignified Federal officer, and scion of a long line of Lavanches, not some suicidal crack troop. He launched a white flare, and surrendered to the approaching units.
<br><br>
But not before being punched by a stump.

<br>
The EFGF Ground Fleet Alpha and the 87th Integrated Fleet were skimming the borders of North America looking for a way in through the patrols. Zeon patrols 1 and 5 were out doing their rounds until they detected the two huge EFGF fleets nearing the border line. The two patrols went forth to engage the Invading EFGF fleets, hoping to catch them off guard.
<br><br>

<br>
The two big EFGF fleets launched their defenses in response to the oncoming patrols. The Mobile suits would act as decoys until the Big trays start their bombardment. Then the sky's filled with Federal Fighters and Medea's. Artillery fire rained from the sky's from the Big trays, Guntank MPTs and GMPGTs. Sniper rounds from the GM snipers take out the dector units in the back as the front units are decimated by the rain of cannon fire.
