<br>
The Buster Ni Go approaches overlord 9 on its own. The Salamis Kai class commanded by Captain Alfred Gardner. The ship departed from the safety of the rest of the Cygnus fleet to carry out an important mission; the destruction of one of Zeon's many resource sattelites and space mines. 
<br><br>
"Move on ahead." commanded Alfred. "Steady now."
<br><br>
As the Buster slowly thrusted through chunks of asteroids and space debris, it neared the facility. The earth Federation Space Forces weren't expecting much resistance, but marines and Saberfish pilots were on standby regardless.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"It's quiet...too quiet." commented Alfred
<br><br>
Suddenly an asteroid rocket cluster was launched at the Salamis Kai
<br><br>
"Its A Trap! Evasive Manuvers!" ordered Alfred.
<br><br>
The Salamis Kai tilted t the side slightly, but the cluster slammed into the already damaged ship. The bridge shook, sirens blared red, and the communications officer Gin shrieked.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"Damage report Sanyo!"shouted Alfred as he began readjusting himself on his throne.
<br><br>
"We can't take another hit Captain or we'll be dead in the water." replied Helmsman Sanyo.
<br><br>
"Put thrusters in reverse and charge up mega paricle cannons." ordered Alfred.
<br><br>
"Yes Sir!" Sanyo confirmed his orders.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
As the second cluster launched at the Buster, the crew was ready. The attack was silenced by the "Fire" order from the captain. The mega particle cannons reduced the cluster to space rubble. The ship pressed onward only to encounter a lone anti-aircraft turret, which was quickly disposed of. An all out bombardment of the facility ensued and the poor panzergreneiders trapped inside were burnt alive before the flames were extinguished by space.
<br><br>
"Gin! Get ahold of the rest of the fleet. Report our progress and request coordinates for a Rendevous." 
<br><br>
"Affirmitive captain." replied the cute ginger haired communications officer.
<br><br>

<br>
The country of Tunisia in North Africa is being rocked day and night by war.  But the earth took the punishment like a veteran boxer in a familiar fight ring.  A soft rumble as the earth sensed the battle that is about to be waged.
<br><br>
The rumble became a roar as the sign of Federal jet turbine engines reached a crescendo.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
It is with regret that Obersturmfuhrer Xaviar Brennan bid fairwell to the Gaw-class <i>Bayonetta</i>.  As wonderful as the aircraft had been, Brennan felt more comfortable in the water.  Capturing the Big Tray-class <i>Hood</i> is a plus in his book but Brennan still prefers the water.
<br><br>
His hand grasps the railing but before Brennan swung into the cockpit of the Z'Gok.  Behind the two Acguys of his MS Team, Specialist Persephone Dawn stood gazing at the Zaku II Manipulator Type.  Funny thing, pondered Brennan, what strange comrades you make in war.
<br><br>
The sudden sound of running footsteps caught his attention.  "What is it soldier?" demanded Brennan.
<br><br>
"Obersturmfuhrer!" panted the crewmember,"... it's... Federal aircraft... inbound!"
<br><br>
"Well don't just stand there!" advised Brennan as he leaped into the cockpit," Sound the alarm! We've got a job to do!  
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
"<i>Bravo leader to Charlie group, I have the eggplant in sight.</i>"
<br><br>
"Roger that Bravo leader," replied Lieutenant Jim Irwin," we are going weapons hot."  The Tin cods from the <i>Lleu Llau Gyffes</i> banked and went to afterburner.
<br><br>
In the Corebooster beside him, Sergeant Scott Archer acknowledges his superior officer.  The memories of his distant family on that terrible day six years ago still haunts him in his sleep.  But right now he is a professional, trained by the Earth Federal Forces.
<br><br>
Further behind them are the brand new Medeas of the newly reformed 42nd Brigade.  Fly Mantas pushed forward ahead of the transports, but keeping the Tin Cods ahead of them.  Following them are Jet Core Boosters and Depp Rogs from the <i>Lleu Llau Gyffes</i>
<br><br>
It was a sight to behold as the three suddenly very lonely Dopps of the Gaw-class <i>Bayonetta</i> try to rush out and stem the tide.  A solitary Lugunn tried to figure out the best way to meet the Federal air armade.  But the numbers are far too great as the Zeon aircraft fell to the opening wave of air-to-air missiles.  
<br><br>
The wave continued until it slammed into the side of the <i>Bayonetta</i> just as the Mega Particle cannons fired.  The beams went past the Tin Cod and Fly Manta ranks and caused much alarm to the Medea Transports.  As everyone was evading the sudden release of beam energy, four forms dropped away from the floundering Gaw.
<br><br>
The Zaku II Manipulator-Type's many arms carried both the 120mm and 90mm machineguns as the Newtype pilot blasted her way down to the ground.  She rolled her already damaged mobile suit upon landing before disappearing into the countryside.  Above her, a single beam from a hidden GM Ground Sniper found its mark on the Gaw, mortally wounding it.  Smoke pour from its airframe as the <i>Bayonetta</i> began to die.
<br><br>
Not far away Brennan and his Acguy team did not get away as easy as the Zaku II Manipulator.  Scott Archer went after the falling aquatic mobile suits despite the repeated cries of the more experienced Jim Irwin to break off.  One of the Acguys exploded in mid-air but then Brennan's Z'Gok and the remaining Acguy opened fire on Archer's Corebooster and thoroughly convinced the Corebooster pilot to leave them alone.
<br><br>
Not long after Archer's attack run, the two Zeonic mobile suits splashed into the water of the Mediterrenean Sea.  Brennan signaled for the Acguy to follow as fast as possible; he saw Don Escargots in the distance before entering the water.  There has to be a Himalaya out there somewhere.
<br><br>
Suddenly from the depths, a beam pick slammed into the Acguy's face.  Corporal Charles Gano cheered to himself as he felt the weapon sink deep into the Acguy.  Then, Gano felt his Aqua GM is yanked off the dead Acguy.  Before Gano can do anything, the fast reflexes of a very aggravated Xaviar Brennan flung the hapless Federal aquatic mobile suit away.
<br><br>
For good measure, Brennan fired a few times towards the Aqua GM.  But time is growing short and the Z'Gok couldn't take the time to properly aim his shots.  He turned and dove for the depths to evade the depth charges of the circling Don Escargots.
<br><br>
A massive explosion above ground signalled the death of the <i>Bayonetta</i> as the enormous Zeon frame ate more warheads than it could have carried in its bombbay.  With a terrifying crash, the mangled hull added to the collection of broken war materiel collecting in Tunisia and the sands of time.

<br>
The darkness of space wrapped around the lone mining asteroid <i>Overlord 9</i>, punctured only by the brightness of stars.  Minerals from this Zeon outpost had been feeding the logistical system of the autonomous Zeon forces.
<br><br>
But all of that is about to change as the ships of the EFSF's Cygnus Fleet moves into attack position.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Captain Reeds studied the asteroid mine from the bridge of the Salamis Revised-class <i>Buster Ichi Go</i>.  Odd how he came all this way to destroy a supply depot instead of tranporting stuff from it.
<br><br>
"Ships are in bombardment position sir."
<br><br>
"Splendid," approved Reed," prepare for to fire-!"
<br><br>
"Captain!  Detecting light sparkles from bearing 114, upper quadrant!"
<br><br>
"Get those gunnery crews working!" barked Captain Reed," what are they?  Mobile Suits?"
<br><br>
"Negative!  They appear to be asteroids... they've been weaponized!"
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
It took Officer Candidate Alex Sentara all of five seconds to realize something was wrong.  He quickly pulled back on the flight stick, narrowly missing an asteroid with a blazing rocket trail.
<br><br>
"Didn't realize it was fish fry night," argued Sentara.  He winced as a Public missile boat collided with an asteroid head on and exploded violently.
<br><br>
"<i>Stay alert!</i>" advised Seaman Derek Carter, as he blew away an asteroid with his twin 200mm cannons.
<br><br>
"Speak for yourself!" retorted Seaman Michael Kruez as he let loose another shot from his bazooka.  The deflected asteroid tumbled into space.
<br><br>
Suddenly above them, a second Public exploded.  The three pilots looked up and grimaced.
<br><br>
The <i>Buster Ichi Go</i> and <i>Albireo</i> were ahead of the Columbus-class <i>Sulafat</i> when they entered firing range of Overlord 9.  Now the ships are frantically moving out of the way of the wave of asteroid rockets while trying not to hit each other.
<br><br>
<i>Buster Ichi Go</i> shook violently as an asteroid struck it close to the Salamis Capsule.  Another two would bounce off its starboard side, damaging the mega particle cannons there.  THe Albireo also took three hits as it swung to port.
<br><br>
The Columbus-class <i>Sulafat</i> took the worst hit.  The ship was pulling up when an asteroid struck it at the rear of its bottom hull by the engine section.
<br><br>
It took a frantic hour before the Cygnus Fleet can coordinate itself back into formation again.  At that point, the fate of <i>Overlord 9</i> was sealed.  Repeated missile and mega particle cannon strikes finally destroys the asteroid mine into tiny pieces of rock.
<br><br>

<br>
It is right before dawn in the Tunisia.  The North African country silently endures the rampages of war.  Perhaps it knows that no matter what happens, this strip of land will outlast any of the warriors that set foot on its soil.
<br><br>
Oberscharfuhrer Rose Adeline did her rounds through the decks of the captured Federal Big Tray-class <i>Hood</i>.  Emerging on the outer deck, the Gouf Custom pilot breathed in the cool air.  She is rather proud of the accomplishment she shares with fellow SS Officers Xaviar Brennan and Ritter Novosad.  Such a feat, reckoned Adeline, would do her guardian Sardo Krugo proud.
<br><br>
"Enjoying your stroll, Oberscharfuhrer?"
<br><br>
Adeline turned and saluted Hauptscharfuhrer Ritter Novosad.  The Panzergrenadier commander is still wearing his armor from the previous day's battle.  His helmet tucked under one arm, Novosad gave an approving nod.
<br><br>
"How are your wounds?" inquired Adeline.
<br><br>
"Nothing that will hinder Gihren's will," retorts Novosad.  His training allowed him not to flinch.  Hastily wrapped bandages under his armor forced the armored SS officer to delegate responsibility to his subordinates.  He will be in command of course, but Novosad will not be on point this time.
<br><br>
"How goes your request for reinforcements?" asked Adeline.  She got a huff in response.
<br><br>
"Alexandria is being slow like a turtle," remarked Novosad," lucky for us that the Feds left instruction manuals to their aircraft.  At least our new pilots can at least take off."
<br><br>
Then he turned towards the sea.  "I manage to convince the captain of a Jukon II that diverging from his course will be more beneficial to Zeon than his destination.  We at least have some fire support."
<br><br>
An armored finger pointed to the distance.  "Plus we still have other friends."
<br><br>
The female SS pilot looked towards the Efreet Custom that is following behind the painstakingly slow Big Tray.  Corporal Alain Grace is flanked by his Gouf and Zaku II K teammates on either side.  The newtype-wannabe is fairly sober now, though his pill dispenser alway stays close to him.
<br><br>
But even medicines and modern drugs cannot shake the voice that haunts his mind.  The repeated cries of "Kill Me!" are strongest here in the cockpit.  If the voice would leave him alone, then Grace can fight at his fullest.  The voice had left him alone during the attack on the EFGF 1st Resupply Fleet and that went pretty well aside from the interruption from an enemy Corebooster.
<br><br>
Back on the outside deck of the Big Tray-class <i>Hood</i>, the small meeting between the SS officers are interrupted by an excited junior officer.
<br><br>
"Sir!  Ma'am!" saluted the young officer," lookouts report immenient enemy contact!"
<br><br>
"That's odd," noted Adeline," I don't hear or see any of the aircraft they are in love with."
<br><br>
"No, not the Federals," corrected the junior officer," we spotted bandits!"
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Like a modern reenactment from a very old Western movie, the three trucks of the African Union charged the Big Tray.  A horde of Guerilla fighters whooped and cheered as they rode into battle.  Wild weapons fire accompanied them as they easily caught up with the captured Federal ship.
<br><br>
The Zeon response is harsh and absolute.  Panzergrenadiers mowed down the first wave of guerilla fighters like wheat before the autumn harvest.  A Magella attack tank rolled off the Big Tray's ramps and imposed itself between the African Union soldiers and the Zeon line.  Above them, a Zeon-piloted Fanfan cut through their ranks with its vulcan gun.
<br><br>
Suddenly, the stolen hovercraft explodes.  Aisha Vemunino swings her 100mm machinegun towards the mobile suits now coming off the <i>Hood</i>.  While she supports neither the Earth Federal Forces or the Duchy of Zeon, she is faithful to contracts.
<br><br>
"Where the hell are the Feds?!" she shouts in the cockpit of her GM Ground Type.  If the EFGF doesn't show up, there's going to be nothing left of the African Union strike force.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Aisha Vemunio needn't have worried.
<br><br>
"<i>Target moving at plus 10 bearing 2 mark 7...</i>"
<br><br>
"<i>Crosswind correction is minus 1.5...</i>"
<br><br>
"<i>T.O.T. bombardment will begin in zero six two five plus twelve...</i>"
<br><br>
"<i><b>FIRE!</b></i>"
<br><br>
The wheel chair bounded Corporal Jack Murphy clenched his teeth as he squeezed the triggers on his Guntank MPT.  "This is for Jane, my love," he muttered.
<br><br>
On the firing line next to Jack Murphy is Corporeal Bigsby Wolfe.  His GM Desert Type can barely hold the railcannon, but it did.  "No need for thinking this time around!" he proclaimed as the North Carolina-born soldier squeezed the trigger.
<br><br>
As one, the many thunderclaps of heavy artillery shook Tunisia.  The 87th Integrated fleet's Big Tray-class <i>Big Soux</i> fired in unison with the Guntank MPT's twin 120mm howitzers and the GM Desert Type's railcannon.  The "Time On Target" or TOT barrage is a calculated artillery strike so that all munitions will land on its target at the exact same moment.
<br><br>
So it did, catching the Zeon force unawares as the <i>Hood</i> slowed to a dead stop.  Adeline felt the Big Tray shake like a rattle as her damaged Gouf Custom stumbled off the Big Tray.  She turned around to see the flaming deathtrap the <i>Hood</i> has become.
<br><br>
"Novosad!" she cried into her radio as Rhin in her Gouf moved past her," the Fed ship is a coffin, get out!"
<br><br>
"<i>You do not need to tell me the obvious.</i>"  A wappa speed past her feet as Panzergrenadiers expertly leave the stricken vessel.  A few more rounds later and the <i>Hood</i> explodes.  "<i>Let's see how they like a taste of their own medicine.</i>"
<br><br>
Out at sea, the shadowy shape of a Jukon II rose to the surface.  Missile tubes open and a wave of missiles flew out of the water.  They quickly turn and head for the Federal artillery position.  Warheads detonated around the <i>Big Soux</i>, Murphy's Guntank MPT, and Wolfe's GM Desert type.  The EFGF will have to do without its artillery force for now.
<br><br>
Which is why they came with their infamous airforce.  An air armada of Tin Cods, Depp Rogs, and Fly Mantas are guided in over the immediate airspace by an experienced Dish aircraft.  The collection of Zeon fighters and captured Federal aircraft rose to meet them in a tornado of air to air missiles.  The first few moments saw kills on both sides as aircraft try to sort out who was friendly and who was not.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Meanwhile, the Medea-class "Spirit of New Amsterdam" flew around the diminishing aerial battle.  It's cargo doors opened and Private First Class Thorvald Siggurdson dropped down in his Blue Destiny mobile suit upon the battlefield.
<br><br>
"C'mon Lass!" beckoned Siggurdson,"let's kick their arse and send them runnin'!"
<br><br>
<font size=2><i>She is here!</i></font>
<br><br>
The Blue Destiny touched down with its 100mm machinegun at the ready.  "Who is here, lass?" asked Siggurdson," talk to me lass, who is here?"
<br><br>
<font size=2><i>She is! From above!</i></font>
<br><br>
The Blue Destiny barely managed to step aside as Alain Grace's Heat Sword slammed into Tunisia's soil.  The Efreet Custom rolled on its landing and spun around, unleashing its leg missile pods at the Blue Destiny.
<br><br>
But Siggurdson threw a grenade, and the exploding fragments destroyed the missile swarm before it can even ruin the lunar titanium armor's paintjob.  Before the smoke even cleared, Grace was rushing towards the Blue Destiny with heat sword extended.
<br><br>
Siggurdson threw his armshield at the approaching Effreet Custom just as Grace fired his arm mounted grenade launcher.  At nearly simultaenous moments in time, the armshield ricocheted off the Efreet Custom's head just as a grenade explodes close to the Blue Destiny's head.
<br><br>
<font size=2><b>Kill Me!</b></font>  The voice came from the Efreet Custom.
<br><br>
"Damn, the drugs stopped.." muttered Grace.
<br><br>
<font size=2><i>I can beat her!</i></font> The Blue Destiny's voice declared as the EXAM system takes control.
<br><br>
"Ye kin do it lass!" encouraged Siggurdon," I am right here with ya!"
<br><br>
What happen next transpired so fast that only a machine's mind can grasp it.  The Efreet Custom dug its heat sword into the ground and polevaulted at the Blue Destiny.  The Blue Destiny in turned sidestepped as it rippled off 100mm rounds. The passing Efreet Custom ignored the projectiles as it jammed the muzzle of the shotgun into the back of the Blue Destiny's knee.  The shot in the vulnerable spot forced the blue giant to its knees.
<br><br>
"LASS!" cried Siggurdson," c'mon and git up!"
<br><br>
<font size=2><i>I will not be beaten!</i></font> 
<br><br>
The Blue Destiny spun around on its knees and cleanly uppercutted the shotgun out of the Efreet Custom's hands.  The chest armaments on the Blue Destiny opened fire, ravaging the Efreet Custom with bullets and missiles.
<br><br>
<font size=2><b>Kill Me!</b></font>
<br><br>
The smoke cleared as the Efreet Custom charged still.  It discarded the Blue Destiny's arm shield that it used to block the onslaught, and returned fire with its own chest vulcans.
<br><br>
Bullets bounced and chipped away at armor as the two blue behemoths got into a slug fist.  Metal fist beat on armor as the two Marions had at each other.
<br><br>
<font size=2><b>Kill Me!</b></font> 
<br><br>
<font size=2><i>I will not die by your hands!</i></font>
<br><br>
Two enterprising GM CCTs showed up on scene at that point, hoping to give the Blue Destiny an edge.  All they did was meet their death as the Efreet Custom tore away from the Blue Destiny and in the blink of an eye punched the cockpits of both GM CCT's flat.  The Efreet Custom then flung one of the lifeless GM CCTs at the Blue Destiny.  Siggurdson saw his mobile suit catch the dead GM CCT, only to see the Efreet Custom came charging at him.  It was gripping the ankles of the other dead GM CCT like a giant flail.  The Blue Destiny adjusted its grip on the GM CCT it caught and parried the Efreet Custom.
<br><br>
The two EXAM mobile suits continues to beat each other with the dead GM CCTs as the rest of the battle went on.  Broken bits of GM pieces began to rain upon Tunisia.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Meanwhile, like a giant metal fist, an armoured formation of Type 61s blazed a trail towards the <i>Hood</i>.  Staff Sergeant Cray Vermillion leads the way in his damaged Type 61.  The tank is missing armor plating but the tanker knew from experience that armor plating wasn't going to protect him from MS weapons.  The lighter load gave him speed though, despite the weight of Staff Sergeant Seth Yamanu and his Marines riding on his hull.
<br><br>
"Didn't we drive through here before?!" questioned Ion Bossa-Nova in the driver's seat.
<br><br>
"Then you shouldn't be lost!" snapped back Vermillion," enemy mobile suit, range 800!  Yamanu!  Get your guys off!"
<br><br>
The Federal marines barely jumped off before the Type-61 boomed with both of its 150mm cannons.
<br><br>
"Cray!  What's that ahead of us?" asked Ion.
<br><br>
Vermillion looked through his viewfinder and saw dark shapes on Zeon wappas.
<br><br>
"Panzergrenadiers!" answered Vermillion," I might be able to hit them with the coaxial!"
<br><br>
"I have a better idea," countered Ion," ram them!"
<br><br>
Novosad looked away from the Big Tray in time just to see an overzealous tank charge him at maximum speed.  Ion lost view of the Zeon armored soldier as she felt the Wappa collide with the front of her tank.
<br><br>
"Woo-hoo!" cried Ion in excitement.  Vermillion was about to join in the celebration when the Type-61 was suddenly rocked to the side.
<br><br>
"Curb-rubbing punk," spat Novosad as he lowered his PZF 3 anti vehicle weapon.  His Panzergrenadiers formed up around him just as small arms fire tore the ground near them.
<br><br>
A firefight erupted as Yamanu's Marines opened fire on the black troopers while other Type-61s manuever themselves closer.  It was a desperate situation as the Panzergrenadiers fell back in order not to be slaughtered by massed heavy armor.
<br><br>
The Earth suddenly shook as Adeline's Gouf Custom fell to the ground. Smoke and hydraulic fluid leaked from the crippled mobile suit.  Inside the cockpit, Adeline furiously kicked at the cockpit hatch.  Suddenly a heavy machinegun opened fire and the rest of the cockpit hatch broke away.
<br><br>
"Oberscharfuhrer?" asked the Panzergrenadier, offering his hand to help her out.  Rarely does one feel so happy to see the red-eyed black armor of these dark troopers.
<br><br>
<center><font color="3300FF" size=4><b>~</b></font></center>
<br>
Their weapons are empty or ripped to pieces.  The two Federal mobile suits they were using as bludgeoning weapons lay in ruins across ten kilometers of sand.
<br><br>
The Blue Destiny limped forward.  It's left arm is missing, and the right hand clutches a beam saber.  The left leg is but a skeleton, barely able to hold it upright.
<br><br>
The Efreet Custom is much worse off.  Unlike the Blue Destiny, it did not have Lunar Titanium armor and thus leaned on the North African ground with its one good hand.  The monoeye looked up as the beam saber rose over the Blue Destiny's head.
<br><br>
<font size=2><b>Kill Me!</b></font> 
<br><br>
<font size=2><i>As you wish.</i></font>
<br><br>
But it is not to be.  Warheads and munitions struck the Blue Destiny, forcing it backwards.  Siggurdson looked out at the distance.
<br><br>
Rose Adeline pointed at the horizon as well.  Ritter Novosad's head turned and inside his helmet he smiled.
<br><br>
Dopps, Zaku IIs, and Doms are approaching them.  In the sky, the massive purple Gaws of Von August grew in size.  The forces of Alexandria has come.
<br><br>
In a short amount of time, the Zeon forces from Alexandria had circled around the surviving Zeon units.  The 87th Integrated Fleet and its African Union allies promptly left, not willing to engage another large force of Zeon units so soon.
<br><br>
Despite all that died today, Tunisia lives on.
