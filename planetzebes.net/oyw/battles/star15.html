The stage had been set, and no both sides were waiting, tense, expectantly, like race horses straining at the gates, waiting to be let out into the field, like two ancient armies, lined up, staring down the muzzles of hundreds of riflemen, who weren't that much different than themselves. The atmosphere was stifling; both armies had very little room to maneuver. The space around A Baoa Qu was packed with ships, mobile suits, and the men who operated them, and their hopes and dreams were mixed in with the Minovsky particle cloud, the like of which had never been seen before.
<br><br>
The stragglers on both sides were still arriving, but the main forces of both armies - the massive garrison at A Baoa Qu, and the EFSF Grand Fleet - had already arrived long ago. The remnants of the Zeon Expeditionary Force joined the garrison, bolstering its already-impressive force with an array of battleships and pilots that would have struck fear in the hearts of their Federation counterparts, had they not been already overwhelemed with the numbers of the garrison. Veronica Wu herself was present, and was currently in a meeting with the Zeon higher-ups, discussing tactics with her perennial coffee in hand.
<br><br>
The 42nd Brigade had also arrived for the Federation, with aces like Aurem Senaiaha, Revil's Savior, the Paladin, and Thorvald Siggurdson, The Demon. Nigel Ferdinand joined Evander Creed in tactical discussion, and they passed on their intelligence to Revil, who had maintained a commanding, official presence for the duration of their meeting.
<br><br>
The stage had been set, but the curtains had not yet been spread. Casting was complete, the preamble had been written, but the outcome was still up in the air, for all the confidence and fear that swirled around A Baoa Qu. It would be the greatest show not on Earth.
