<br>The maps are divided into three types of area: Territories, Locations, and Compounds. Locations exist inside Territories, and Compounds can exist inside Locations or Territories. You may only move between adjacent areas, and each move is one move action. For example, Side 5 is a Location inside the Territory 2 Days from Earth (2E), and Texas Colony is a Compound in Side 5. It is one move action to go from 2E to Side 5, and another to go from Side 5 to Texas Colony. The reverse is also true.
<br>
<br>Base pages can be found by clicking on the individual flags on the map. Installations are the larger flags, while Facilities are the smaller flags. Individual base pages alternate between present defenses and descriptions/map via links on the names.
<br>
<br>
<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b>Earth Sphere</b></font></center>
<br>The map of the Earth Sphere is broken into six territories, dubbed "Days from Earth" and ranging from 0 to 5. For example, 2 days from Earth is adjacent to 1 day from Earth, 3 days from Earth, and any Locations inside 2 days from Earth. The Earth Orbit Location at 0 Days from Earth is used when moving on or off of Earth.
<br>
<br>The following are the list of Locations in the Earth Sphere Territories, and any additional rules and restrictions that apply to movement in the Earth Sphere.
<br>

<br>
<br><b>Earth Orbit</b>
<br>Players must be on a Compound equipped with a Spaceport to move from Earth to Earth Orbit, or moving to a Compound equipped with a Spaceport on the planet. Space class ships can move to and from Spaceport equipped compounds, but they may not move to any other Earth locations.
<br>
<br><b>(O)</b> class ships and mobile suits can move from Earth Orbit to any Location or Compound on Earth. They must use spaceports to return to Earth Orbit.
<br>
<br>Ships with M Craft systems can move to Earth Orbit from any Location or Compound on Earth freely.
<br>
<br><b>Sides 1/4 and 2/6</b>
<br>Sides 1 and 4, and Sides 2 and 6, orbit each other, and are adjacent. You may move between these two pairs without moving to 3 days from Earth.
<br>
<br>
<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b>Area Descriptions</b></font></center>
<br><b>0-5 Days from Earth</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> While truly a vast expanse of nothingness, a century of habitation and eight months of war have added a minimum amount of landscape to the area around the planet Earth. It is not uncommon to see the odd civilian shuttle or derelict battleship even in the vastness of space, and the CMC maintains a few small stations where shuttles can stop in case of emergency. However, it is just as likely a traveler will spend several days with nothing to look at but the stars.
<br>
<br><b>Earth Orbit</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font>  Just outside Earth's atmosphere. This region is relatively clean, due to the fact that most debris from destroyed war machines quickly burn up in the atmosphere. Beware of combat here; smaller craft,  chiefly fighters and mobile suits, run the risk of being caught by gravity and falling to their deaths.
<br>
<br><b>L3</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font>  The colony clusters orbit the Earth in 5 gravitational "Lagrange points". These are areas in which there is a gravitational equilibrium, allowing objects of large mass to maintain their orbits indefinitely. Following the Lourm campaign, the colonies of Side 7 were equipped with boosters and moved out of L3 and closer to Earth. Currently the region of L3 is completely empty, far from both war and civilization.
<br>
<br><b>Moon</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font>  More than a billion people live here in 0079, the Moon covered with semi-underground lunar cities. The Zeon have a medium-sized base here where they test weaponry in a low-gravity environment, but most of the moon's surface is dotted by independent settlements loosely governed by the LMC. The massive city of Von Braun dwarfs them all, the largest single habitation outside the planets surface.

<br>
<br><b>Side 1</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The site of the original Space Colony and the first of the seven Sides, Side 1 was decimated in the early weeks of the war, indiscriminate nuclear fire tearing its colonies and its peoples apart. Once home to over a billion human beings, now one tenth of that live in the regions twelve surviving cylinders. The rest of the Side resembles a graveyard, filled with floating scrap metal, dead battleships and the broken and lifeless husks of space colonies. The CMC maintains a small amount of autonomy from the original space colony at Shangrila, tending to the needs of Side 1's survivors as best it can.
<br>
<br><b>Side 2</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> Not too far from its orbiting safe haven of Side 6, Side 2 is just as much of a shoal zone as most of its brethren, a mere eleven colony cylinders surviving the battles of January 0079. In order to prevent the Earth Federation from being able to move through Riah occupied space and around the defense line, the asteroid fortress Solomon was moved into a defensive position at Side 2, controlling the surviving colonies as well as acting as the primary base of the SAF and staging ground to attack Luna II.
<br>
<br><b>Side 3</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The home of Fascism in the Universal Century. Side Three is the Zeon Duchy's homeland, and a huge colony cluster. In possession of over 120 closed cylinder colonies, Side Three is also the most heavily populated colony cluster. The Zeon capital colony, Zum City, houses the Zabi Castle, where the Hitleresque Zabis command their armies.
<br>
<br><b>Side 4</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> Orbiting Side 1, Side 4 was also turned into a gigantic shoal zone and graveyard during the One Week War, only nine colonies surviving the carnage of nuclear war. Following the Antarctic Treaty Zeon moved its asteroid fortress Pezun to this region, which defends Zeon's far flank even though being primarily a research base. The surviving colonies are under self rule, but taxes and tributes are taken by the SAF to maintain the war effort.
<br>
<br><b>Side 5</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font>  This colony cluster was once home to the Federation's strongest supporters in space. Now, it too is a shoal zone.  Side 5 fared the worst of all the sides during the One Week War, now being completely devoid of operable colonies, with the exception of the half dead Texas Colony. Right in the center of the current battle lines in space, Side 5 provides a monstrous garden of floating debris to be used for ambushes and tactical operations.
<br>
<br><b>Side 6</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font>  This is the largest intact colony cluster between Earth and the moon. Side Six declared itself neutral months before the war began, and was thusly spared any aggression by the Zeon during the disastrous Lourm Campaign. As this side is neutral and mostly pacifistic, combat of any kind is strictly prohibited. However, soldiers from both sides are free to spend their leave here.  Severe penalties apply to any individuals who chose to continue the war within Side Six airspace.
<br>
<br><b>Side 7</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font>  Something of a misnomer of a Side, Side 7 was just beginning construction when the Earth Federation decided to halt the production of new colonies. Because of this, Side 7 only consists of two colonies and a handful of way stations. Still under the control of the Earth Federation, the Side 7 was equipped with boosters and moved into Federation held space following the Lourm campaign, and are now used as a testing base for new Federation weaponry.
