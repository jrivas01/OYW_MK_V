<br>The maps are divided into three types of area: Territories, Locations, and Compounds. Locations exist inside Territories, and Compounds can exist inside Locations or Territories. You may only move between adjacent areas, and each move is one move action. For example, Side 5 is a Location inside the Territory 2 Days from Earth (2E), and Texas Colony is a Compound in Side 5. It is one move action to go from 2E to Side 5, and another to go from Side 5 to Texas Colony. The reverse is also true.
<br>
<br>Base pages can be found by clicking on the individual flags on the map. Installations are the larger flags, while Facilities are the smaller flags. Individual base pages alternate between present defenses and descriptions/map via links on the names.
<br>
<br>
<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b>Jupiter Sphere</b></font></center>
<br>The map of the Jupiter Sphere is broken into six territories, dubbed "Days from Jupiter" and ranging from 0 to 5. For example, 2 days from Jupiter is adjacent to 1 day from Jupiter, 3 days from Jupiter, and any Locations inside 2 days from Jupiter. Jupiter contains two Orbit locations, High Orbit and Low Orbit, with High Orbit adjacent to 0 Days from Jupiter and Low Orbit adjacent to High Orbit.
<br>
<br>The following are the list of Locations in the Jupiter Sphere Territories, and any additional rules and restrictions that apply to movement in the Jupiter Sphere.
<br>
<br><b>Locations List</b>
<br>0 days from Jupiter<font color="#3300FF"><b>:</b></font> High Jupiter Orbit<font color="#3300FF"><b>:</b></font> Low Jupiter Orbit
<br>1 day from Jupiter<font color="#3300FF"><b>:</b></font> -
<br>2 days from Jupiter<font color="#3300FF"><b>:</b></font> Io, Jovian Colonies
<br>3 days from Jupiter<font color="#3300FF"><b>:</b></font> Ganymede, Europa
<br>4 days from Jupiter<font color="#3300FF"><b>:</b></font> Callisto
<br>5 days from Jupiter<font color="#3300FF"><b>:</b></font> -
<br>
<br><b>Low Jupiter Orbit</b>
<br>The Low Jupiter Orbit location may only be moved to from High Jupiter Orbit and vice versa. It is impossible to travel to Low Jupiter Orbit without a ship, although having travelled there with a ship some MS can fight there normally.
<br>
<br><b>Purchases</b>
<br>You may not make any purchases other than Compounds, their accessories, and Variants in the Jupiter Sphere. Rogue members may additionally purchase Services, Cargo, and Infantry. Rogue members allied with the JDEG may make purchases as normal.
<br>
<br><b>Weather</b>
<br>Low Jupiter Orbit is already a dangerous place, prone to heavy gravity and violent gas storms. Sometimes however, the storms are more violent than usual. Weather for Low Jupiter Orbit will be determined once a week. Just because one location is experiencing bad conditions doesn't mean you will be caught in it, but it's better to be prepared than try your luck.
<br>
<br><b>Deep Space</b>
<br>It is possible to travel to the Mars Sphere, Earth Sphere or Asteroid Belt from 5 Days from Jupiter. This is not something you're expected to do regularly, and rules for this are listed on the <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1587&page=1#16663" target=new><u>message board.</u></a>
<br>
<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b>Area Descriptions</b></font></center>
<br>
<br><b>0-5 Days from Jupiter</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> With close to 50 million citizens, the Jupiter Sphere is the second most inhabited planet in the solar system, home to more people than the Asteroid Belt and Mars Sphere combined, the oldest human settlements older than the very first space colony. The JDEG recently announced its autonomy from the Earth Sphere as an independant nation, but attempts to colonize the moons have only begun this year. Jupiter space is mostly empty, with spacecraft sightings few and far between, but the tremendous gas giant is always on everyones mind, taking up the vast majority of the night sky.
<br>
<br><b>Callisto</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The second largest of the Gallilean moons and the least active, Callisto is much like the Earths moon, a huge lifeless rock. While there are mining operations planned for Callisto, Ganymede is a much better candidate for colonization.
<br>
<br><b>Europa</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The smallest of the four Gallilean moons, Europa is covered by a thick layer of ice, under which there is a sea of flowing water. Much like Ganymede, Europa is used as a resource mining center for the JDEG, and there are future plans for colonization. While it has yet to be properly explored, it is rumored that there may be aquatic life in Europas ocean.
<br>
<br><b>Ganymede</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The largest moon in the solar system and posessing a thin Oxygen atmosphere, Ganymede is the most hospitable place in the Jupiter sphere, although survival outside of a normal suit is still impossible. The JDEG is beginning plans to colonize the surface of Ganymede, their 131 year old Jovian culture now ready to properly populate the Jupiter Sphere.
<br>
<br><b>Io</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The second smallest of the Gallilean moons, Io is still much larger than Earths moon. With a thin and toxic atmosphere and a huge amount of active volcanic activity, it is not very hospitable to the prospect of colonization. Because of its short distance from Jupiter itself, it has a very fast orbital path, and stretches and distorts at certain points of its orbit.
<br>
<br><b>High Jupiter Orbit</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> An orbital trajectory far from dangerous altitudes, spaceships and mobile weapons can travel here about as normally as they could in Earth Orbit. However, the gravitational pull on a mobile weapon is still strong in this zone, and mobile suits not designed for Jovian conditions will have some difficulty maneuvering here. Much like at lower altitudes, running out of fuel here can still be quickly fatal.
<br>
<br><b>Low Jupiter Orbit</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> At the very edge of the gas clouds and storms of Jupiter, this area is where the Jupiter Collection Fleets harvest Helium 3. Gravity here is more intense than on Earth, and can have detrimental effects both on pilots and their mobile weapons. Only ships may travel freely here, and mobile suits that are not designed for a Jovian environment can only operate as stationary gun turrets. Combat here is extremely dangerous. MS fuel is eaten quickly trying to stay out of the gravity well, and freak storms can push huge amounts of dense atmosphere into a formation.
<br>
<br><b>Jovian Colonies</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> Although still in its fledgleling stages, a booming civilian population mixed with a large influx of war refugees have stimulated the growth of space colonies, just outside of the orbital ring of Io. At the moment only two colonies exist, but another four are expected to finish construction by the end of the year. This Side 8, otherwise known as the "Jovian Side" or simply the Jovian colonies currently orbit the JDEG HQ, using the Side 3 closed cylinder design to protect against Jupiters fierce radiation belt. The JDEG plans to create a full 100 colony side within eighty years, an ambitious project in such a remote part of the solar system.
