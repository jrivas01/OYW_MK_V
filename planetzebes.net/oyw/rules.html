<br>
<br>Welcome to the Play By Email RPG, One Year War. This RPG is dedicated to the anime series Mobile Suit Gundam, and all the related side-stories it has spawned over the last 30 years. I am your webmaster, Ketara. If you're new here, you may want a bit of an explanation as to what a PBEM game is. If you aren't new, you can probably <a href="rules.html#skip"><u>skip</u></a> to the meat of the rules page.
<br>
<br>
<br>A Play By Email RPG is a text based roleplaying game designed to allow character freedom and RPing via message boards, while creating a strategic environment with rules and statistics on the website. Each update characters send actions via email, and everyone's actions are updated that night on the website by myself.
<br>
<br>While actions are maintained on the website, players are free to roleplay and interact with each other on the forum. However, combat between characters is handled via battle writing on the website itself.
<br>
<br>Because of the strategy game element, you are not required to roleplay to play the game. However, this is not encouraged, and players that make an attempt to RP will see their characters getting various game upgrades much quicker than players that do not RP.
<br>
<br>Battles are handled by the games staff. Each day battles in the game are given to writers, who portray the PC characters on both side's to the best of their ability. After battles characters are injured, gain experience and abilities, and the game moves on.
<br>
<br>Below are the rules for the game part of the RPG. If you are having any trouble understanding them, please contact me via <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5spam&action=display&thread=1575" target=new><u>IRC</u></a>, the email <a href="mailto:oywrpg4@gmail.com"><u>oywrpg4@gmail.com</u></a> or via <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi"><u>forum PM</u></a>, and I will be more than happy to help you through the workings of the game.<a name="decorum">
<br>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Proper decorum</b></font>
<br>
<br>Generally I never have problems with members breaking rules. But just in case, here are a few common sense rules of the game.
<br>
<br>Game Rules - Don't metagame. Metagaming is the act of intentionally making your character do something that character would not do to satisfy out of character interests. No joining the RPG as more than one character.
<br>
<br>Forum Rules - Don't powergame. Powergaming is the act of controlling another character/NPCs in your RP posts without their permission. Don't make OOC posts on the RP sections. Anything goes in Open Discussion really, but if you're going to post porn or something please tag it NSFW.
<br>
<br>Chat room Rules - Don't be an asshole. Don't take things people say in the chat too personally. The chat isn't really my jurisdiction, so don't expect me to have much control over it.<a name="updates">
<br>
<br>
<br><a name="skip">
<br><font size=4><b>Updates</b></font>
<br>
<br>The RPG updates Monday to Thursday, the weekend saved for processing joining forms, site maintenance, writing special events and having a life. Each character is allowed to send one action email per weekday update.
<br>
<br>While the writers and I do try to get everything done on time, sometimes we have to miss an update, and sometimes updates are finished late at night. In the event that we miss an update, an additional action update will be held on Friday to make up for this.
<br>
<br>For in-game continuity purposes, each weekday update represents a single day in the Gundam world. Weekend updates are skipped over, although this does not prevent RPing during the weekend.<a name="emailing">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>E-mailing</b></font>
<br>
<br>You are allowed one action email per update day. The email deadline is 5:30 PM Pacific Standard Time. You may send an email after the deadline, but I may discount any late actions. I can't include a character in a battle that is already being written.
<br>
<br>Please make your email title as detailed as possible, because it makes updating much quicker and easier. Some examples include "Sabine Rocos, Defecting" or "Fria Engel, Colony Drop". I will accept other titles, but may discount an email titled "lol wtf" or something similar.
<br>
<br>Please try to make the content of your email understandable. If your email is confusing I may read it wrong and you may end up doing the wrong thing. I will talk to you about this if I have consistent problems understanding your emails.
<br>
<br>Joining emails can be sent any time, and should be titled "Joining". However, new characters will not be added until the weekend. Other emails, things discussing plans or asking questions, are accepted at any time.
<br>
<br>The email address for all RPG related emails, actions or otherwise, is <a href="mailto:oywrpg4@gmail.com"><u>oywrpg4@gmail.com</u></a>.

<br>
<br><a name="yourcharacter">
<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b><a href=rules.html#top style="color: #3300ff">Your character</a></b></font></center>

In the OYWRPG, you control a character in either the Earth Federation or Republic of Zeon military, or a Rogue agent who is employed or interacts with these two warring powers. Most characters are mobile suit pilots, although it is possible to be a ship commander, aircraft/tank pilot, or infantry personnel. The game environment is one of the military, <a name="vp">but you do not have to follow orders of higher ranked characters, and within this environment may with few exceptions portray your character how you see fit.
<br>
<br>Your character is represented in the game by the following eight statistics.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>VP</b></font>
<br>VP or "Veterancy Points" shows piloting ability. Fighting somebody with a lower VP score doesn't ensure your victory,<a name="cp"> but the higher your VP is, the better a pilot you are. VP is raised through combat using VP.
<br>
<br>Sometimes a pilot may captain a ship, a damaged unit, or pilot a unit other than their own. In these situations a PC operates at half effective VP level, rounding up.<a name="nt">
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>CP</b></font>
<br>CP or "Combat Points" show skill in infantry combat. While the OYW is a war of mobile suits, espionage, ambushes and firefights still occur. CP is raised through combat using CP.
<br><a name="rank">

<br><font size=4><b>NT</b></font>
<br>NT stands for Newtype Rating. Newtypes in Gundam represent the next step of human evolution, people with a sixth sense and minor telepathical abilities. Your character is given an NT score at joining, and as long as this score is at least a 1, it can be improved through good RPing and special events. Newtype Rating is scaled from 0 to 10. A more in-depth explanation of NT Rating is found on the <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5questions&action=display&thread=1581" target=new><u>message board</u></a>.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Rank</b></font><a name="rp">
<br>Each non Rogue character has a division and a rank. Your rank determines your salary in RP, and high ranks give access to special events and officer message boards. While there is no rule against disobeying a officers in the RPG, I would like to stress that the groups with the best teamwork have the most success in winning the war. Promotions can be given for good RPing, or for successful completion of special events. The different divisions and ranking systems are found on the <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1583" target=new><u>message board.</u></a><a name="specializations">
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>RP</b></font>
<br>RP or "Resource Points" are used to purchase ships, supporting mobile weapons and other things out of the shops. RP does not signify money, rather political influence within the military. You will receive an RP salary based on rank every Sunday update. Some special events can net a player RP as well.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Specializations</b></font><a name="divisions">
<br>Specializations note a special skill at fighting a certain type of battle or in a certain environment. Some classes start the game with one, and they can also be gained from good RPing or special events. For example, Cherish Woods has the Ace specialization, which gives her a temporary +10VP when fighting enemy ships.
<br>
<br>In any situation where a pilot is operating at half VP or CP, they receive full bonus from specializations.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Classes</b></font>
<br>If you join Zeon or Federation you choose one of seven classes, with Rogues in a class of their own. Your class dictates your starting stats, as well as available mobile weapons, divisions and starting positions. For now don't worry about classes. Once you've finished with the rules, they are explained in full on the <u><a href="joining.html" target="iframe">joining</a></u> page.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Mobile Suit</b></font>
<br>Not a quality of your character, but their machine. Your starting mobile weapon is from a choice given by your class, and through good RPing or game circumstances you may be given upgraded models as the war goes on. There will be times when you may change your mobile weapon if you wish, but you are only allowed to do so at these specific times.
<br>
<p>
<p><a name="msteams">
<br><a name="bases&ships">
<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b><a href=rules.html#top style="color: #3300ff">Bases and Ships</a></b></font></center>
Through shop purchases, special events, or theft, it is possible to obtain ships, fleets, bases and MS teams, and each have their own rules.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>MS Teams</b></font>

<br>Soldiers on Earth rarely fight alone, even in the Universal Century. You are allowed to purchase an MS team to fight alongside you from the shop. MS teams consist of yourself, and up to 3 additional purchased units. The MS team acts as an extension of your character. It fights with you, and cannot be attacked while you are repairing.
<br><a name="ships">
<br>Due to the difficulty of moving troops through space, MS teams are only allowed on Earth. If you move from Earth to Space and do not have ships to transport your MS team in, you forfeit the team.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Ships</b></font>
<br>Ships are important even in the age of mobile suit combat. A ship can provide supporting firepower, carry mobile suits into combat, and provide refueling and re-armament in the field.
<br>
<br>Player owned ships operate like players themselves, controlled by the PC owner. Each ship can make one action per day. Many ships can transport units, and their transport capacity is noted on their roster entry. Player characters riding in ships <b>do</b> count towards the maximum transport capacity.
<br>
<br>Ships are divided into classes. A ships class consists of two words. <a name="fleets"> The first refers to what terrain it operates in, either Space, Land, Naval, or Airborne. The second refers to grade, defining what special actions it is able to make. The three grades are Supportcraft, Carrier and Battleship. For example a Columbus is a "Space Carrier" whereas a Dobday is a "Land Battleship". A complete list of available ships is found in the shop.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Fleets</b></font>
<br>Multiple ships can be formed into a fleet. With a fleet, instead of singling out and targeting one ship, an enemy must attack the entire fleet. Fleets can make some actions that ships cannot make. However, fleets are only allowed a single action per update. The owner of a fleets flagship controls the actions of the fleet.
<br>
<br><a name="msmarules">A fleet must consist of 3 or more ships at the same position, and a flagship must be designated. The flagship must be of Carrier or Battleship grade. Some fleets are allowed support units in addition to their hangar capacity. Every Earth based fleet can be supported by up to 6 vehicles, and up to 3 mobile suits. Every Earth Federation Space based fleet can be supported by up to 10 Balls. A Ball is a type of aircraft, found in the shop.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Fed MS Rule / Zeek MA Rule</b></font>
<br>Each side has a special rule for Battleship grade ships they control. EF players may have a single mobile weapon supporting a Space Battleship over <a name="bases">its hangar capacity, and Zeon may tow a single mobile armor behind a Battleship over its hangar capacity.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Bases</b></font>
<br>Players can control bases, colonies, and mines as well. These things do not make actions, but are positions that can be moved to and attacked of their own accord. Some will net their owner additional RP every Sunday.<a name="npclvldmg"> They have hangar capacities like ships, but unlike ships, PC mobile weapons and teams do NOT count towards a bases hangar capacity, nor do ships at the bases position.
<br>
<br>Bases also have grades, showing their ability to control territory. These are Facility, and Installation. Compound is used in the rules to refer to both.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>NPC unit levels</b></font>
<br>NPC units have VP and CP like players. Each NPCs VP is listed as a level from 0 to 5, for example a lvl2 GM. The NPCs VP is 16(level), and their CP is 6(level), with lvl0 meaning 1 VP/CP. Infantry units have 0 VP and higher CP scores as listed in the shops.
<br>
<br>Anything listed without a level is lvl1. Named NPC units can have a maximum level higher than 5. For example, a base entry may have a "lvl11 Gouf Custom (Norris Packard)". Named NPC ships may have different VP levels for the bridge and gun crews respectively. For example, a "lvl 6/5 Magellan (Green Wyatt)" has a lvl6 bridge crew and a lvl5 gun crew.
<br>
<br>Some NPCs are also Newtypes or SS officers, noted with an N or I after their level respectively, such as "lvl3N". Unnamed NPCs have an NT of 2, but named NPCs will have their NT rating listed after the N. For example, "lvl3N7 Elmeth (Lalah Sune)".
<br>
<p>
<p>
<br><a name="death&dying"><a name="repairs">
<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b><a href=rules.html#top style="color: #3300ff">Death and Dying</a></b></font></center>

Unfortunately sometimes a character will be killed. The following are rules for death, injuries, repairs and all the ramifications thereof.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Damage</b></font>
<br>Your roster entry has a status section, noting whether or not you are ready for battle, as either OK or damaged. The 7 damage types are "Repairing", "Injured", "Destroyed", "Fatigued", "Jailed", "Upgrading" and "Missing in Action", each type accompanied by a number of points. Each update a players damage of each type is reduced one point. For example, on Monday Berrik Radhok is ambushed and becomes "Repairing 3, Injured 2". This becomes "Repairing 2, Injured 1" on Tuesday, "Repairing 1" on Wednesday, and "OK" on Thursday.
<br>
<br>Players with a damaged (not OK) status cannot attack or be attacked, although they can make other actions as normal. In the above example, Berrik cannot make an attack action till the following Monday update, but can still move and make purchases Tuesday to Thursday. You may participate in a battle while damaged if you are on a ship, fleet or base that fights while you are damaged, but your operating VP, as well as VP gain will be halved. (rounding down)
<br><a name="death">
<br>There are slight differences in the five different damage types, which are explained in full on the <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1587&page=1#20335" target=new><u>message board</u></a>. The word "damaged" is used in the rules to refer to all five types.
<br>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Death</b></font><a name="shipsrepairs">
<br>Players who die are effectively taken out of the game for 7 updates. During this time they create a new character. The new character has 75% VP/CP of the old character rounding up, a new NT score, and is 1 rank higher. During the 7 "death" updates you cannot make any actions, RP transfers or move, but you may still make actions with ships and fleets you control.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Ship Repairs</b></font>
<br>Ships are damaged in a different way. They have six status ratings; OK, Lightly Damagedd, Damaged, Heavily Damaged, Severely Damaged, and Disabled. Ships can fight with any status but Disabled, but operate at lower effectiveness accordingly. Disabled ships may only make an Emergency Repair action, meaning they cannot move or attack. They may still be attacked.
<br>
<br>Ships repair automatically when on compounds. Ships on compounds are repaired 1 damage grade per update, +1 if the compound has a repair bay. For example, Rey Tatsuma's Salamis spends Tuesday without action at Luna II, and goes from Heavily damaged to Lightly damaged. Ships may not be repaired more than two grades per update, and forfeit repairs if they make an action that update.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>NPC units</b></font><a name="capture">
<br>NPC mobile weapons do not take damage, they are either OK or destroyed.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Capture</b></font>
<br>Characters can be captured by enemy forces, held in a bases cellblock or ships brig. This is indefinite, and based on circumstances you may be executed or interrogated for side board passwords. A captured player cannot make any actions except escape attempts. Escape attempts are more likely to succeed if coordinated with an outside attack. Captured PCs do not have access to their side's message boards.
<br>
<br>Captured PCs may move ships and fleets they control, and transfer RP like a normal character.

<br>
<p>
<br><a name="actionsdd">
<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b><a href=rules.html#top style="color: #3300ff">Actions</a></b></font></center>
Now that you know about your character, their abilities and how they become damaged, you need to learn about making actions. Your character and each ship/fleet you control can only make one action per update. Certain things don't count as an action, and can be done in addition to your daily action.<a name="nonactions">
<br>
<p>
<br>
<br><font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>Non Actions</b></font>
<br>
<br>Purchasing from the player shops is not an action, with two exceptions. The shop pages detail specifics on what you can purchase and where. Purchasing is an action when Building compounds or Refitting a unit, which is covered in the Special Actions section of the rules.
<br>
<br>Repairs never count as an action, although you cannot make a Battle action while repairing.
<br>
<br>Transferring RP and ship ownership from one character to another never counts as an action, although RP cannot be used until the update after it is transferred. Players may not transfer ownership of bases unless the original owner dies.
<br>
<br>Boarding/disembarking a ship, moving units between MS teams in the same position, and forming/disbanding a fleet do not count as actions. However, if the units in question are attacked that day, whether the battle takes place before or after the re-organization is up to webmaster discretion.<a name="actions">
<br>
<p>
<br>
<br><font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>Actions</b></font>
<br>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Move</b></font>
<br>The map is divided into three categories; territories, locations and compounds, where position is used to refer to all three. Moving from one position to an adjacent position is an action. The <u><a href="map.html" target="iframe">map</a></u> page lists all the positions. You can send an action to move somewhere far away, and I will plot a course for you, or you can specify your own course.
<br>
<br>Compounds are a position within a location/territory. For example, Eli Staedtler is in the North America location on Monday, and wishes to move to Belfast, a compound in Europe. He moves from North America to Europe on Monday, and Europe to Belfast on Tuesday. Monday his roster reads "Moving to Belfast, 1 day". On Wednesday Eli can act on Belfast as normal. The reverse is also true. For example, Vincent Tatum in Constantinople, a compound in Europe, would have to move to Europe before being able to move to North Africa.
<br>
<br>Please note that on the Position tab in a players roster, there may be a secondary position in parenthesis after the first, such as "Europe (Normandy)". For game purposes ignore the part in parenthesis, this is flavor text to assist with roleplaying.
<br>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Battle</b></font>

<br>All battles are actions. You may only attack an enemy at your position. Using the Eli Staedtler example, Eli can be attacked in North America on Monday, and in Europe on Tuesday. Attacking does not interfere with the victims action for the day, with a few exceptions. There are 5 different types of battle.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Duel</b>: Duels are organized fights between two or more parties. Both side's must send Battle actions for a duel. They are worth 8-10 VP/CP, and engender heavy damage.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Ambush</b>: Ambushes are self explanatory. Only the attacker needs to make a Battle action. Ambushes are worth 6-8 VP/CP, and the attacker is given the advantage of surprise.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Spar</b>: A spar is a friendly match between members of the same side, using low power beam settings and paintball rounds. Both parties must send Battle actions. Spars are worth 4-6 VP/CP, and cause low damage.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>All Range attack</b>: All Range attacks are our term for sniper fire or artillery bombardment. Only the attacker needs to make a Battle action, and the defender may only return fire with All Range weaponry. All Range attacks are worth 2-4 VP/CP, and the attacker is given the advantage of surprise.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Assault</b>: Assaults are any attack on an enemy Compound. The attackers do not have to be on the Compounds position in order to attack it, assaulting from the location the compound is in. For example, John Church is a Zeon PC in Europe, and wishes to attack Belfast on Monday. He can do so without moving to Belfast, and only Federal PCs at Belfast can defend the base. If the Assault is victorious the attackers are placed on the Compounds position, if it is not then they do not move.
<br>
<br>Other types of battle supercede Assaults in all scenarios, unless it is a battle resulting from a Paradrop action. If Church Assaults Belfast on Monday, but Cameron Sune ambushes him, the ambush will play out and the assault will not. This is the only case of one battle cancelling another.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Plans and Organization</b></font>
<br>It is encouraged to send attack plans along with a battle action, although we may ignore plans that are impossible or out of character. Where multiple players are attacking one target, only one needs to send a battle strategy. For example, five players led by Altecha Chan attack the Conscon fleet. Chan sends in a battle strategy, the other four writing "I am following Chan's plan" or "I am not following Chan's plan and am doing this instead." Optional armament loadouts are the exception, and must be stated by the player themselves.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Optional Armaments</b></font>
<br>Mobile weapons have listed optional armaments and optional features. In a battle email, you should list a weapons loadout. If nothing is listed the writer will make the decision for you. Carrying everything you can is not always the best idea, as it slows down your mobile suit. This is detailed further on the <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1584&page=1#16652" target=new><u>message board</u></a>.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>RP Actions</b></font>
<br>The above actions and the below special actions do not incorporate everything that can be done in the RPG. Sometimes special scenarios call for special actions, and I encourage <a name="specialactions">people to be inventive with what they are trying to do. However, I may veto actions not on these lists if I don't think they're reasonable.
<br>
<p>
<br>

<br><font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b><a href=rules.html#top style="color: #3300ff">Special Actions</a></b></font>
<br>
<br>In addition to move actions and battle actions, players, ships, fleets and even compounds have special actions they can make. These are organized in lists below. Ships can use both the Ship and Player lists, and Fleets can use the Fleet, Ships and Player lists. Compounds can only use the Compounds list.
<br>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Players</b></font>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Build</b>: You must engage in a Build action in order to purchase a Compound from the shop. Ships and Fleets may not make Build actions, although you may make a Build action if on a ship/fleet that makes no other action that day. Being attacked cancels Building.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Orbital drop</b>: Some ships and MS are capable of making Orbital Drops. This action can only be made from the Earth or Mars Orbit locations. Units making orbital drops are allowed to assault any Compound on Earth/Mars from Orbit. Only compounds may be the targets of Orbital Drops. MS may not Orbital Drop when damaged.
<br>
<br>Some ships are capable of participating in the orbital drop, such as the Pegasus, whereas others drop their MS compliment while remaining in orbit, such as Musais. Patrols in orbit can intercept Orbital Drops, but patrols in the location being moved through cannot.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Overwatch</b>: An Overwatch action consists of advanced preparation for an ambush. If you are ambushed on overwatch the advantage of surprise will be given to you rather than to the ambusher. A character who is on Overwatch 3 updates in a row automatically becomes Fatigued 1 the fourth update. You may not Overwatch if Injured or Fatigued.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Refit</b>: Some ships and mobile suits can make Refit actions. Specific rules on this are listed on the Variants sections of the side shops. If a ship in a fleet makes a Refit action, other ships in the fleet can only make Refit, Repair or Emergency Repair actions. Being attacked cancels Refitting. Repairing or Destroyed mobile suits/ships cannot be refitted.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Scout</b>: A player can make a Scouting action to attempt to scout the defenses of any base adjacent to their position. A roll will be made on the Scouting table, and if successful a scouting report will be posted on that side's passworded message board. Each base only needs to be scouted once, and a scouting report will assist planning of assaults on that base. Ships, Fleets and players inside Ships may not make Scouting actions. Being attacked cancels a Scouting action in the same way as an Assault action. You may not Scout when damaged.
<br>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Ships</b></font>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Emergency Repair</b>: A Disabled ship may make an Emergency Repair action, changing its status to Severely Damaged. If a ship in a fleet makes an Emergency Repair action, other ships in the fleet can only make Refit, Repair or Emergency Repair actions. Being attacked does NOT cancel Emergency Repairs.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Paradrop</b>: Entirely Airborne class ships and fleets are capable of making Paradrop actions. The paradropping ship/fleet moves and then immediately engaging in a battle on the same update day. For example, Aleksander Dolvich is on a Medea, an Airborne Carrier, in the Atlantic Ocean. Alek makes a Paradrop action, and is allowed to move from the Atlantic to Europe, immediately Ambushing Berthold Stulinger the same day. If a Paradropping ship is attacked only the movement part of the action is made.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Repair</b>: Some types of ship can make Repair actions. This action repairs a damaged ship one grade of damage, so long as the ship being repaired does not make an action. If a ship in a fleet makes a Repair action, other ships in the fleet can only make Refit, Repair or Emergency Repair actions. A ship may not Repair itself. Being attacked cancels Repairs.
<br>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Fleets</b></font>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Blockade</b>: Fleets can Blockade their current position. Enemies wishing to move from that position have a chance of being attacked by the Blockade. Units engaged by the Blockade that lose do not complete their movement action. Damaged MS cannot be engaged by a Blockade, but if they are intercepted they do not move. A Blockading fleet can also engage someone making an Assault action, nullifying the Assault action. Being attacked cancels Blockades.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Patrol</b>: Fleets on Patrol work like Blockades, but instead of engaging enemy moving out of their position, Patrols engage enemy moving into their position. Patrols can also engage players making Build actions. Being attacked cancels Patrolling.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Siege</b>: Sieges are a blockade on a Compound in the fleets location/territory. The Sieging fleet moves to the Compounds position, and any enemy units moving on or off the compound MUST engage and defeat the Sieging fleet in order to do so. Players on a compound being Sieged cannot make shop purchases other than Services. There are a few unique rules governing sieges listed on the <u><a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1587" target=new>message board</a></u>. Being attacked does <b>not</b> cancel a Siege.
<br>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Compounds</b></font>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Colony drop</b>: <a name="designations">Certain compounds in Orbit are capable of making Colony Drops. These actions are unique and have different rules every time they are performed, and should be discussed with me before they are taken.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Strip mine</b>: Mine and Asteroid Mine compounds can make strip mine actions. This action immediately nets the compound owner 1.5 times the normal rate of RP, and will then stop producing RP altogether. Being attacked cancels Strip Mining.
<br>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Special Unit Designations</b></font>
<br>Some units have special designations, which give them certain exceptions to the rules.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>All Range class (A):</b> These units have extreme range weaponry. They can perform All Range attack actions, and participate in Bombardments during a Siege.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Detector class (D):</b> Detector units have advanced scouting and communications equipment. They improve a teams chances of evading/intercepting a Patrol/Blockade, increase the accuracy of All Range attacks, and lessen the advantage given to enemy by Ambush and Overwatch battles.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Large Mobile Suit (L):</b> While not a Mobile Armor, some MS, such as the Zeong and Zock, are huge mobile suits. These units take up two spaces in a hangar.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Orbital Drop class (O):</b> These units can make Orbital Drops, and can freely move from Orbit to a planets surface. (O) class ships are noted whether they can only drop their MS compliment, or can move to the planet themselves.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Repair class (R):</b> These ships contain all the personnel, equipment and spare parts necessary to refuel, restock and repair other warships. (R) class ships can make Repair actions.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Stealth class (S):</b> These units have an easier time slipping by patrols and blockades, and have an increased advantage when Ambushing or on Overwatch.

<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b><a href=rules.html#top style="color: #3300ff">Politics and Territory</a></b></font></center>
Locations in the game can become controlled by either side, something players have a direct hand in doing. The rules for capturing and losing locations, as well as the benefits of owning locations, are listed below.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Territory</b></font>
<br>There are four different types of territory; Friendly territory, Contested territory, Enemy territory and Neutral. Territory changes will be made during weekend updates.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Friendly territory:</b> A position in which your side controls one or more Installations (not a Facility), and the enemy does not control any Installations. Compounds inside Contested territory count as Friendly territory. Compounds that produce RP every Sunday produce 1.5 times the amount in Friendly territory, rounded down. Players may only purchase ships in Friendly territory. Shop items from the Services list are half price in Friendly territory, rounded up.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Contested territory:</b> A position in which neither side controls any Installations, or both side's control one or more Installations. Facilities inside Enemy Territory count as Contested Territory. There are no bonuses or minuses for Contested Territory.
<br>

<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Enemy territory:</b> a position in which your side controls zero Installations, and the enemy side has one or more Installations. Players may not purchase Services from the shop in Enemy territory.  If a player builds a compound in Enemy Territory and is attacked that update, not only is the Build action nullified, but the RP used is lost as well. Damaged players not on a ship/fleet cannot make a Build action in Enemy territory.
<br>
<br> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> <b>Neutral territory:</b> Positions controlled by one of the minor powers. Ships do not <a name="orbit">repair in neutral territory, and players cannot make shop purchases in neutral territory. PC mobile suits repair as normal. Fighting is prohibited in neutral territory by the Antarctic Treaty, but not by the RPG rules - although attacking somebody in neutral territory may alter your side's Diplomacy with that faction.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Orbit</b></font>
<br><a name="siderp">Orbit locations can be controlled but use different rules. Each spaceport on the planet in Friendly Territory, and each Installation at orbit or 0 days from Earth/Mars, gives its side 1 point towards controlling Orbit. The side with the most points controls it, recieving patrols by that number. If both side's have an equal number of points, the location is contested.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Side RP</b></font>
<br><a name="patrols">Each Side is given a certain amount of RP each Sunday from its territory. Side RP is used to resupply damaged fleets and bases, and for special events throughout the RPG. Side RP is never given directly to players, but the special events in which it is used will greatly assist the war effort.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Patrols</b></font>
<br>Controlled territory has NPC fleets or MS teams patrolling it. This represents the amount of <a name="diplomacy">control a side has over its respective locations. Only Earth Locations, the Moon, Side 3, Side 6 and Orbits can have MS team patrols. The number of patrols present will be 4 +1 per non-mine non-ruin Compound and supply fleet at the Location after the first, -1 per enemy non-mine non-ruin Compound. Where the patrols are and what they consist of are found on the <u><a href="bases.html" target="iframe">Bases</a></u> page, and the actual chances of being caught by patrols is found on the <u><a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1584&page=1#16646" target=new>message board</a></u>.

<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Diplomacy</b></font>
<br>Each Side has a Diplomacy rating with each of the four Neutral powers in the game, the Colony Management Corporation (CMC), Lunar Management Corporation (LMC), Jupiter Development Enterprise Group (JDEG), and Riah Republic of Side 6 (Riah). Actions made by characters may raise or lower these ratings. There are five possible diplomacy ratings; Allied, Friendly, Neutral, Unfriendly and Hostile. Bonuses and penalties to each rating for each neutral power are found on the <u><a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1584&page=1#16655" target=new>message board</a></u>.

<br>
<br><font size=4><b>FFAs</b></font>
<br><a name="tournaments">Free For All or FFA events happen on holidays, and are an excuse to add as much comic hilarity as possible to the RPG. FFAs award VP and winners will receive prizes, but other than this FFAs happen outside of the continuity of the RPG. When an FFA is held members must email saying they wish to participate, but their position and status in the game itself will not change.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Other Rules</b></font>
<br>While this page handles 90% of the games rules, there are some other things you can look at. If you are thinking of joining as a Rogue, the Rogue Rules page lists additional things that apply to them. The Map page details movement, and the message board has sections on things that weren't properly clarified on this page, such as how NT scores and patrol/blockade attacks are randomized.<a name="joining"> These pages are not required reading, but are there all the same.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Joining</b></font>
<br>The section on joining the RPG is on the <u><a href="joining.html" target="iframe">Joining</a></u> page. I would however like to thank you for your patience and participation in reading the rules. I know this is a much more complicated game than most PBEM RPGs, and it can take some getting used to.
<br>
<br>If you have any questions regarding the rules or would like assistance in joining, please contact me. There are many ways to contact me. My email is <a href="mailto:oywrpg4@gmail.com"><u>oywrpg4@gmail.com</u></a>, and I am often found in the <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5spam&action=display&thread=1575" target=new><u>IRC chat</u></a>. You can also reach me by <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi" target=new><u>Forum PM</u></a>. If you cannot find me, the people in the chat can very likely assist you.

<br>Hope you enjoy your stay here.
