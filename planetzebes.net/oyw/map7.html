<br>The maps are divided into three types of area: Territories, Locations, and Compounds. Locations exist inside Territories, and Compounds can exist inside Locations or Territories. You may only move between adjacent areas, and each move is one move action. For example, Side 5 is a Location inside the Territory 2 Days from Earth (2E), and Texas Colony is a Compound in Side 5. It is one move action to go from 2E to Side 5, and another to go from Side 5 to Texas Colony. The reverse is also true.
<br>
<br>Base pages can be found by clicking on the individual flags on the map. Installations are the larger flags, while Facilities are the smaller flags. Individual base pages alternate between present defenses and descriptions/map via links on the names.

<br>
<br>While the majority of the combat in the Universal Century happens in the Earth Sphere, the planets beyond Earth and especially Jupiter have long been of some importance to humanity. Should you wish to extend the One Year War to areas beyond the Earth Sphere, there are rules for travelling between planets.
<br>
<br><b>Entering Deep Space</b>
You move onto the Deep Space map from either 5 days from Earth, 3 Days from Mars, 5 Days from Jupiter, or the Asteroid Belt sectors Farside and Nearside. You must move through the Asteroid Belt to travel from 17 Days from Sol to 18 Days from Sol. Mobile Suits may not move on the Deep Space map by themselves, you must use a ship or a compound to enter Deep Space. Space Colonies may not enter Deep Space without a booster.
<br>
<br><b>Interplanetary Spacecraft</b>
Only ships equipped with Nuclear Pulse Engines and Solar Sails travel at normal movement in Deep Space. Conventional warships and space colonies travel at abysmal speeds, taking weeks or even months to reach their destination. When plotting your course, use the following chart to find how long your journey will actually take. Note that all of the modifiers below are cumulative.
<br>
<br><b>Rates:</b>
<br>No Solar Sail - 2x travel time
<br>No Nuclear Pulse Engine - 2x travel time
<br>Supportcraft Class - 2x travel time
<br>Lightly Damaged/Damaged - 2x travel time
<br>Heavily Damaged/Severely Damaged - 4x travel time
<br>Asteroid Mine/Space Fortification/Colony w. Booster - 4x travel time
<br>Colony/Space Fortress/Asteroid Fortress - 8x travel time
<br>
<br><b>Plotting a Course</b>
<br>Ships move through Deep Space by accelerating for half of their journey and decelerating for half of their journey, plotting a course for where the planetary body will be on its orbital path when they arrive, rather than where it is when they leave. Because of this, once a ship or fleet enters the Deep Space map, it may not change course until it reaches its destination, nor may it stop moving at any time. Compounds are not affected by this rule. You may plot a course to a Compound that is stationary in Deep Space, dock there and then move from it. Ships moving through Deep Space may make Refit, Repair and Emergency Repair actions while continuing their movement.
<br>
<br><b>Purchasing and Repairs</b>
<br>Shop Purchases of any kind are not allowed in Deep Space, with the following exceptions: Variants, Pilots while on a compound in Deep Space, Terrorist contact service, Dummy units service or Mechanic service while on a compound in Deep Space.
<br>
<br><b>Combat</b>
<br>Combat is possible in Deep Space, but due to the complicated nature of plotting a course it must be planned for in advance. If you wish to attack a fleet inside of deep space, you must declare this when you make your original action to move through Deep Space. (Because of this you cannot attack a ship that moves into Deep Space after you do.) When the two sihps/fleets move past each other a battle will occur. The winning force will continue to move, and the losing force will be halted 1 day while it corrects its course. Both sides will move in a draw. Mobile Suits may duel on ships moving through Deep Space as normal.

<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b>Area Descriptions</b></font></center>
<br>
<br><b>5-26 Days from Sol</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The civilized part of the solar system is only so large. Interplanetary transport is not uncommon in the Universal Century, but the farther away from a planet you travel, the more it turns into an inhospitable frontier. Space becomes barren and cold, and travel without a well supplied ship is impossible. The CMC maintains a single satellite station at 12 Days from Sol, to assist interplanetary traders moving between Earth and the outer planets.
<br>
<br><b>Asteroid Belt</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> Used as an endless supply of metal resources for building space colonies and war machines, the Asteroid Belt supports a small population of miners. Ships must retract solar sails when travelling through this region, as interstellar debris can damage this sensitive equipment.
<br>
<br><b>Earth Sphere</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The birthplace of humanity, the Earth Sphere remains the most important planetary body in the solar system, housing 98% of humanity, and home to all of its wars and politics.
<br>
<br><b>Jupiter Sphere</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The second most important planetary body in the solar system, Jupiter is used to mine the heavy Helium 3 gas used in Minovski-Ionesco ultracompact fusion reactors, which are used to power all modern space colonies, warships and mobile suits. It was colonized by the JDEG prior to the creation of the first space colony, and has recently declared independence from the Earth Sphere. Huge Jupiter Energy Fleets travel between Jupiter and Earth, facilitating trade between the two planets as well as the Asteroid Belt.
<br>
<br><b>Mars Sphere</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> Almost as lifeless as it was before space travel began, Mars is home to an abandoned colonization project, CMC miners moving to the Asteroid Belt when it became the more profitable location. A tiny number of colonists remain on the surface, a single CMC city exporting a small and shriveling mineral trade.
