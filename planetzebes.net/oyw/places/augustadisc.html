<br>West Africa, Eastern Canada
<br>Coastal Arctic Fortification
<br>Corini
<br>
<br>Settled far to the north of Canada, the name Augusta base is actually somewhat misleading, named after a town on the northeastern coast of North America. The base is hidden from Zeon, its small spaceport accepting next to no traffic in this day and age, and because of this it has avoided detection. Further, its position in the icy north, and compliment of cold climate mobile suits makes it a tough customer. Augusta is used to test new Terrestrial designs, and sports a cadre of excellent pilots to boot.

<br><b>Corini</b>
<br>A bitter and angry man, Corini does not see why Revil has restationed him out in the frozen north, and frankly believes that the Earth Federation would be much better off with some different leadership. He is good friends with Bosque Ohm and Jamitov Heiman, and part of the old, racist elite of the Earth Federation that loves huge battleships, hates the mobile suit, and hates spacenoids even more.

<br><b>Christina Mackenzie</b>
<br>A young spacenoid from Side 6, Christina volunteered for the war right at its outset, patriotic and upset with the immorality of Side 3's indiscriminate nuking of the space colonies. Although an excellent pilot, she does not have the right mind for battle, and is happy with her position testing new designs in the frigid north.
