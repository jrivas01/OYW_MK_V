<br>Asteroid Belt, Center
<br>Asteroid Fortress with attached Asteroid Mine (Under Construction)
<br>Maharaja Kahn
<br>
<br>Built in the far reaches of the Asteroid Belt in order to control the Helium 3 trade, the point of AXIS has been discarded with the signing of the Antarctic Treaty, but with substantial resources put into the project it is now fully autonomous and capable of completing its construction on its own. A massive pair of asteroids lashed together, AXIS is equipped with giant nuclear pulse engines in order to move to the Earth Sphere at a later date.

<br><b>Maharaja Kahn</b>
<br>Sent to AXIS largely because of pacifist tendancies, Maharaja Kahn is well liked by his men, but it is also well known that he disapproves of the war. One of Zeon Zum Deikuns old followers, he believes in peaceful revolution, not the warring policies of the Zabis.

<br><b>Haman Kahn</b>
<br>The daughter of Maharaja Kahn, Haman is only fourteen years old, but has already shown great prospects as a candidate for newtype training. She has been piloting mobile suits nearly since they were invented, and has recently been given a custom newtype unit sent from Granada.
