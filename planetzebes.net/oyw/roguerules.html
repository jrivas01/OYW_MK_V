<p>
<br>The OYW was home to many Rogue agents, such as the guerrillas in 08th MST, Doan, Miharu, Pergamino, and Kelly. Rogues in the RPG operate under the same rules as Zeon and Federation members, with a few additional rules and a few exceptions to the normal rules. This page explains these differences.
<br>
<p>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Starting statistics and Joining</font></b>
<br>Instead of picking a class, you have minimum starting stats as a Rogue, and a lump of points used for specializing your character, with specifics on the <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1583" target=new><u>message board</u></a>. You do not start with a mobile weapon, but must purchase one with your own RP.
<br>
<p>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Ships and Fleets</b></font>
<br>Rogue ships, fleets and units behave normally, with the following exceptions. Rogue fleets can have flagships of any class. Rogues use both the <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1587&page=1#16666" target=new><u>Zeon MA rule</u></a> and <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1587&page=1#16666" target=new><u>Federation MS rule</u></a>. They also use the <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1587&page=1#16666" target=new><u>Rogue NPC rule</u></a>; All Rogue owned units have the Operative specialization.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Damage</font></b>
<br>Rogues add 1 point to their repair time. Rogues repair normally in Friendly territory, and take Injury and Destroyed results as normal. For example, Bishop Kratos could be attacked, resulting in "repairs, 5 +1, injury 2".
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Shop Purchases</b></font>
<br>Rogues use the Rogue shop, and may purchase from the Federation and Zeon shops, at 2x price. Rogues may only buy Infantry, Pilots, Services and Variants from the Rogue shop. Rogues may purchase ships from the Rogue shop on Earth in Contested Territory.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Changing Mobile Weapons</b></font>
<br>Rogues may change units by buying a new unit from the shop with a Sell action. If their old unit is repairing or destroyed it is lost. If it is OK, it may be moved to their MS team or a ships hangar.
<br>
<p>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Actions - Battles</b></font>
<br>Rogues have a sixth type of battle they can engage in, explained below.
<br>
<br><b>Blackouts</b>: A Blackout is an ambush where the Rogue disguises themselves as a unit from a specific government. This can have ramifications with Diplomacy. A Blackout is worth 4-6 VP.
<br>
<p>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Actions - Special actions</b></font>
<br>Rogues have the following additional special actions:
<br>
<br><b>Train</b>: Rogues may Train if undamaged, or if Repairing or Destroyed on a Carrier or Battleship. Training gives 2 VP or CP. Being attacked cancels Training. Ships cannot train.
<br>
<br><b>Forage</b>: Foraging gives the Rogue 25 RP at the end of that update. Being attacked cancels Foraging. This action cannot be made while injured. Ships and Injured characters cannot forage.
<br>
<br><b>Sell</b>: Sell actions can be used to change mobile suit, trade, the Hacker contact, and/or pawn units for RP. Rogues may also make a Sell action to sell scouting reports or board passwords to Zeon, EF, or other Rogues. Specifics are listed on the <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1584&page=1#16651" target=new><u>message board</u></a>. Being attacked cancels Selling.
<br>
<br><b>Hide</b>: After making a Hide action, a Rogues position is listed on the website as "Hidden", and their movement becomes secret. Hidden targets may only be attacked by Patrols and Blockades, which unhide them. Ships and Fleets cannot Hide. Any action other than Moving, Training or Foraging unhides you. You cannot Build while Hidden. Being attacked cancels Hiding.
<br>
<br><b>Sieges</b>: Rogues are allowed the Infiltration action during compound sieges. This is explained on the <u><a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1587" target=new>message board</a></u>.
<br>
<p>
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Territory</b></font>
<br>Rogues count all territories as Contested, with the exception of LMC, CMC, Riah and JDEG territory, or compounds they control. These are Friendly Held. Rogues may not control territory without a Team.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Teams</b></font>
<br>Two or more Rogues may form a Team. Teams must have an HQ, either a compound or a fleet, as well as a leader. Teams are given a weekly salary of 25 RP per team member, the leader receiving an extra 25. Teams have one set of diplomacy scores used by all of its members.
<br>
<br><font size=4><b>Diplomacy</b></font>
<br>Each Rogue has a Diplomacy score for each of the diplomatic powers in the game. The bonuses and penalties for these scores differ, and are explained on the <u><a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1584&page=1#16655" target=new>message board</a></u>.
