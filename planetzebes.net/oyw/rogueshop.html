<br><center><font size=4><b>Shop and Purchase Rules</b></center></font>
<br>Although purchases in general are a non-action (compounds and variants being the exceptions), each shop section follows slightly different purchase rules. These are all explained here, followed by the lists of items.
<br>
<br>An items Owner is ONLY the player on the items Owner tab.
<br>
<br>"Limit 1" items may only be purchased once per player per update.
<br>
<br>Compounds are purchased by making a Build action. Terrain is purchased with the Compound, and cannot be added after it is built.
<br>
<br>Defenses and Add-Ons may only be purchased for a compound you Own, and may be purchased at any time, even if you are not on the compound.
<br>
<br>You may purchase mobile weapons, WMDs, cargo or pilots at your position at any time, or for a base/ship/fleet if you are on it. You may also purchase mobile weapons, WMDs or pilots for a base/ship/fleet you Own at any time, even if you are not on it.
<br>
<br>Ships may be purchased at your position or on a base that you Own at any time IF that position is Friendly Territory.
<br>
<br>Services may only be purchased at your position, and may only be purchased in Friendly or Contested Territory. They are 1/2 price in Friendly Territory.
<br>
<br>Variants may only be purchased for a unit by its Owner, and it requires a Refit action. Soft refits can be made anywhere, but Hard refits must be made on compounds.
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br><center><font size=4><b>Compounds</b></font></center>
Compounds, which consist of Facilities and Installations, may be purchased through a build action, and consist of any stationary defensive location. Fortresses and Fortress equipped colonies count as Installations and can control territory, while the rest of the compounds count as Fortifications and cannot control territory. All compounds must have a Terrain chosen from the Terrain list.
<br>
<br>Only up to four Compounds at a given Position will produce income.
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/ruin.png">
<br><b>Ruin</b>
<br>Even the most powerful defensive position in history at some point turns to rubble due to war, deceit, or the passage of time. Every compound that is destroyed becomes a Ruin, which retains its terrain bonuses and can still field a small fighting force. Ruins do not contest or control territory, but can still be moved to as a seperate position, and can be rebuilt back to a Fortification in the same area.
<br>-
<br>- Standard defenses: None, max. 0
<br>- Built-in accessories: Makeshift HQ
<br>- Hangar capacity: 1x infantry, 2x mobile suit, 1x vehicle, 1x mobile armor
<br>- Income: None
<br>- Restrictions: Ruins count as the grade of territory of the Location they reside in, and may not purchase add-ons other than minefields, trenches and listening posts.
<br>- Cost: N/A, created as the result of a destroyed compound
<br>- Special: Ruins can be rebuilt into a Fortification for a build action and 275 RP.
<br>
<br>
<br><a href="profiles/colony.html"><img src="sprites/colonyderelict.png" border=0></a>
<br><b>Derelict Colony</b>
<br>Hundreds of space colonies were destroyed in the early weeks of the war, and while most are now only floating debris, a few remain as monstrous hulks, possibly with a few areas still pressurized. These derelicts can be important tactical positions to a military, which can hide ships inside the colonies or their monstrous shadows. Derelicts can be purchased, but may also be created as the result of a destroyed Colony, much like Ruins.
<br>- 
<br>- Standard defenses: None, max. 2
<br>- Built-in accessories: Damaged Mirrors, Damaged Hydroponics, Damaged Propulsion System, Ship Dock, Makeshift HQ
<br>- Hangar Capacity: 1x infantry, 6x mobile suit, 8x vehicle, 2x mobile armor
<br>- Income: None
<br>- Restrictions: Only purchasable at Sides 1, 2 or 4. May not purchase add-ons other than minefield and listening post.
<br>- Cost: 200 RP
<br>- Special: Derelicts may be repaired into functional colonies for a build action and 800 RP. Derelicts may be purchased two at a time in a bunch formation for 375 RP.
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/fortification.png">
<br><b>Fortification</b>
<br>In essence, a mini-base. These are little more than a hanger for mobile suit placement, and an airfield. They have no walls guarding it, no heavily armored buildings, etc, but are good for the economist, or somebody wanting a cheap, quick, stopgap measure to guard something.
<br>-
<br>- Standard defenses: None, max. 20x
<br>- Built-in accessories: Airfield, Hangar, Barracks, Cellblock, Radar/Communications Tower, HQ, Port if Coastal/Island/Naval
<br>- Hangar capacity: 4x infantry, 8x mobile suit, 10x vehicle, 2x mobile armor
<br>- Income: 40 RP
<br>- Cost: 300 RP
<br>- Special: Fortifications can be upgraded to a Fortress with a second Build action.
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/mine.png">
<br><b>Mine</b>
<br>The Mine is a fairly straightforward operation, yet it is an excellent money maker. Mines are built and deployed on their own, or attached to a Fortress as an add-on. They slowly suck minerals, Helium 3, ore, Vespine Gas, crude oil, Tiberium, or whatever other local asset out of the ground, and bring income to it's owner.
<br>-
<br>- Standard defenses: None, max. 5x
<br>- Built-in accessories: Mining Compound, Airfield, Hangar, Barracks, Radar/Communications Tower, HQ
<br>- Hangar Capacity: 2x infantry, 4x mobile suit, 1x vehicle, 1x mobile armor
<br>- Income: 80 RP
<br>- Cost: 350 RP
<br>- Special: One Mine can be purchased on an existing Fortification or Fortress as an add-on for a build action.
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/asteroidmine.png">
<br><b>Asteroid Mine</b>
<br>An asteroid half the size of a colony, this is a true symbol of economic might. Passages colonize its interior, making it easy to mine valuable ores from inside. Due to the activity on a mine, few fixed defenses can be placed on an active Mine, but you can always move one Asteroid Mine to orbit around a friendly colony for protection.
<br>-
<br>- Standard defenses: None, max. 5x
<br>- Built-in accessories: Mining Tunnels, Hangar, Ship Dock, Barracks, Comm Room, HQ, Propulsion System
<br>- Hangar Capacity: 2x infantry, 4x mobile suit, 5x fighter, 1x mobile armor
<br>- Move Rate: 1/4th normal
<br>- Income: 80 RP
<br>- Cost: 400 RP<br>- Special: One Asteroid Mine can be purchased to orbit an existing Space Colony for a build action.
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/fortress.png">
<br><b>Fortress</b>
<br>The Gundam equivalent of a military base, a Fortress is a symbol of power wherever it is constructed and allows you to control the nearby terrain. A Fortress is essentially a group of factories, warehouses, barracks, hangars and such surrounded by a large, thick concrete wall. Fixed defenses can be purchased as well to increase the ability of your base to survive an attack.
<br>-
<br>- Standard defenses: None, max. 40x
<br>- Built-in accessories: Outer Wall, Repair Bay, Airfield, Hangar, Barracks, Cellblock, Radar/Communications Tower, HQ, Port if Coastal/Island/Naval

<br>- Special: Fortresses can only be built with a build action on an existing Fortification.
<br>
<br>
<br><a href="profiles/colony.html"><img src="sprites/colonymirrored.png" border=0></a>
<br><b>Mirrored Space Colony</b>
<br>This sixty-kilometer long cylinder is home to five million people. Inside, people go about their daily lives as though they were on Earth. Although designed to house a civilian population, space colonies can be equipped with a small defensive armament, and have a large hangar. While a Facility normally, a Fortress can be built inside a Space Colony, upgrading it to an Installation.
<br>-
<br>- Standard defenses: None, max. 10x
<br>- Built-in accessories: Reflective Mirrors, Hydroponics bays, Propulsion System, Repair Bay, Hangar, Barracks, Ship Dock, HQ, Comm Room

<br>
<br><a href="profiles/colony.html"><img src="sprites/colonysealed.png" border=0></a>
<br><b>Sealed Space Colony</b>
<br>Similar to the standard colony, the "Sealed" colony was built primarily in the Zeon homeland of Side Three. Unlike a conventional colony, the Zeon Sealed Colonies had no windows, enabling them to house up to ten million people, while light was provided giant fluorescent arrays. These make the Sealed Colony more expensive to construct, but make it more difficult to destroy in general, as there are no weak windows to aim for. All other aspects are the same as a regular colony.
<br>-
<br>- Standard defenses: None, max. 10x
<br>- Built-in accessories: Solar Panels, Hydroponics bays, Propulsion System, Repair Bay, Hangar, Barracks, Ship Dock, HQ, Comm Room

<br>- Restrictions: Only purchasable at Side 3
<br>- Cost: 1,600 RP<a name="locations">
<br>- Special: Sealed colonies can be purchased two at a time in a bunch formation for 2,800 RP. A Fortification may be built on a Sealed Space Colony.
<br>
<br>
<br><center><font size=4><b>Terrain</b></font></center>
Each Compound must be built with a type of Terrain. While standard and coastal are free and make limited changes to the compound, there are also more expensive options that can deter enemy units, such as Desert or Arctic. Some bases must have a paid-for option to be placed in a specific area, such as Naval or Island for a compound in an ocean sector. You can buy combinations of terrain, but some combinations aren't allowed. Please use common sense.
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/standard.gif">
<br><b>Standard</b>
<br>Built in a normal, pleasant or temperate environment on the plains, steppe or rolling hills, these fortresses are often the cheapest to construct and maintain, but do not offer the geographical bonuses of other options. In the case of Space Colonies and Asteroid Mines, this is the normal option.
<br>-
<br>- Advantages: None
<br>- Disadvantages: None
<br>- Cost: Free
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/coastal.gif">
<br><b>Coastal</b>
<br>Built into the coast, these fortresses include a harbor for tendering marine vessels and controlling the seas. Although this will increase the number of theatres your fortress can effectively support, at the same time it will increase the number of ways in which it can be attacked.
<br>-
<br>- Advantages: Naval ships can move to and be repaired on a Coastal base.
<br>- Disadvantages: Allows the base to be amphibiously assaulted.
<br>- Cost: Free
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/arctic.gif">
<br><b>Arctic</b>
<br>In order to facilitate your rule in frozen tundra type areas, these specialized fortresses will be necessary. Outfitted with much more insulation on structures, better anti-freeze systems and other such details, fixed defenses can function well enough here, but performance of mobile suits and mobile armors will be hampered. Defending player-controlled mobile suits and armors can be outfitted with gear to survive such an environment, though only specialized grunt suits can operate at peak efficiency.
<br>-
<br>- Advantages: Cold Climate mobile suits can work wonders here while other, standard-issue suits will take a beating.
<br>- Disadvantages: Only Cold Climate grunt suits can work at peak efficiency here. Standard mobile suits will grind to a halt in the cold.
<br>- Cost: 50 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/desert.gif">
<br><b>Desert</b>
<br>In need of extra cooling systems and other such gear, fortresses in desert climates and on barren worlds will need these extra outfittings. Again, defending player-controlled mobile suits can be outfitted with gear to survive the extreme environment, but only specialized mobile suits operate at peak efficiency.
<br>-
<br>- Advantages: Mobile suits designed for these extreme environments work well here.
<br>- Disadvantages: Sand can badly clog up vents and weapons on conventional mobile suits and mobile armors.
<br>- Cost: 50 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/lunarsurface.png">
<br><b>Sealed</b>
<br>Cities on moons and the martian surface are semi-underground, buildings built on the surface with extensive basements connecting them, and the entire complex sealed from the inhospitable void outside. Most cities on the moon are built around craters, which facilitate this kind of building perfectly. These cities, and cities that are completely underground, are the only possible way to build a habitable settlement on the lunar or martian surface.
<br>-
<br>- Advantages: Allows the compound to be built on a moon or Mars.
<br>- Disadvantages: Accidental explosions can cause depressurization easily.
<br>- Cost: 50 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/tropical.gif">
<br><b>Tropical</b>
<br>In need of extra radiators and other such gear, tropical and heavily forested climates spell trouble for mobile suits. Defending player-controlled mobile suits can be outfitted with gear to prevent moisture and undergrowth from damaging systems, but only specialized mobile suits operate at peak efficiency.
<br>-
<br>- Advantages: Mobile suits designed for these extreme environments work well here.
<br>- Disadvantages: Moisture can badly  damage electronics and weapons on conventional mobile suits and mobile armors.
<br>- Cost: 50 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/island.jpg">
<br><b>Island</b>
<br>Built on top of a small island with the coast as perimeter defenses, these fortresses are difficult to get on or off of. Attacking units will find the combination of having to cross the water to fight on land aggravating, whereas defending units will find retreat an equally difficult option.
<br>-
<br>- Advantages: Attacking mobile suits will have to move across water or air to assualt the base. Non Hovercraft Land Battleships cannot move to this base.
<br>- Disadvantages: The islands small size will make it more susceptible to bombing, and retreat will be difficult.
<br>- Cost: 100 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/mountain.gif">
<br><b>Mountain</b>
<br>Built into the side of a mountain, mountain fortresses are almost as hard to capture as underground bases, though easier to destroy. Attacking mobile suits will have to scale the mountain itself all the while being hailed by machine gun and mega particle cannon fire. Also, thanks to thinning atmosphere, aircraft cannot function with their usual lethality.
<br>-
<br>- Advantages: Enemy aircraft will be restricted and land forces will advance more slowly.
<br>- Disadvantages: Your own aircraft will have a hard time due to thinning atmosphere.
<br>- Cost: 200 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/urban.gif">
<br><b>Urban</b>
<br>Genocidal maniacs love this little ditty, your base is built right in the middle of a massive city! Maneuvering is hard, firing without hitting civilians is harder, and battles will look like the first episode of Robotech. If combined with an underground base, you could literally create the most advanced base in the history of Anime. Yes, NERV is now at your disposal.
<br>-
<br>- Advantages: The city this base is placed inside produces an income, much like a mine, and the buildings provide good cover for friendly units.
<br>- Disadvantages: To put it bluntly, the civilians will hate you.
<br>- Income: 40 RP
<br>- Cost: 250 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/naval.gif">
<br><b>Naval</b>
<br>Essentially a gigantic ship, a floating Naval Fortress floats on the surface of the ocean, either anchored to the ocean floor, right along the edge of a beach, or mindlessly wandering the seven seas. From here, submarines, marine mobile suits and marine mobile armors can call home.
<br>-
<br>- Advantages: These fortresses make controlling the seas much more feasible and make attack from conventional mobile suits nearly impossible. Non-Hovercraft Land Battleships cannot move to this Fortress.
<br>- Disadvantages: The large pontoons that keep these structures afloat are excellent targets for mobile armors and submarines that manage to get close enough.
<br>- Note: Naval compounds can move anywhere a Naval ship can move at a 1/4 rate.
<br>- Cost: 300 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/space.jpg">
<br><b>Space</b>
<br>Large floating spacedocks lacking gravity, a handful of these were made prior to the construction of the space colonies, facilitating the original migrations to Jupiter and the Asteroid Belt. While they have served their purpose economically, Space Fortresses have a new niche as military bases, cheaper to construct than building a fortress inside of a space colony.
<br>-
<br>- Advantages: More compact than a space colony and entirely a military installation, it is much more difficult to infiltrate this fortress than a space colony with a military base inside it.
<br>- Disadvantages: The lack of gravity, as well as lack of size, can cause problems with allied forces.
<br>- Note: Space compounds can move at 1/4th the normal movement rate.
<br>- Cost: 300 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/atmospheric.jpg">
<br><b>Atmospheric</b>
<br>Using multiple Minovski-craft compressors, much like those used on Zeon airborne mobile armors, it is possible to levitate a fortress in orbit, allowing it reign over the wild blue yonder. Halfway between space and earth, an Atmospheric Fortress is excellent for monitoring movement on and off a planet.
<br>-
<br>- Advantages: Because of its altitude, the number of enemy units that can actually attack such a base is very limited. Air units cannot fly high enough, and Space units will be fighting dangerously close to terminal descent elevations.
<br>- Disadvantages: Like the floating Naval Fortress, the Minovski craft compressors are good targets.
<br>- Cost: 500 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/underwater.gif">
<br><b>Underwater</b>
<br>Unlike their floating brethren, these fortresses are actually built as pressurized buildings on the bottom of the ocean with tubes connecting them. Marine mobile suits have even more of an advantage here. However, due to the nature of this location, only Depth Charge launchers and Torpedo batteries can be constructed.
<br>-
<br>- Advantages: Puts marine mobile suits at a ridiculous advantage against assaulting forces and is also increasingly hard to destroy from the surface. Non submersible ships cannot move to this compound.
<br>- Disadvantages: Several good, solid torpedo hits could cause a massive depressurization resulting in a fortresses' destruction.
<br>- Cost: 500 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/underground.gif">
<br><b>Underground</b>
<br>Perhaps one of the hardest to attack fortresses available, an underground fortress is built completely underground, save for a few camouflaged gates. Pop-up accessories are added to all fixed defenses, allowing them to pop-up out of the ground and surprise enemy units. Even if enemy units manage to locate the entrances to an underground fortress, it will still be hard to take through winding passages and tight corridors.
<br>-
<br>- Advantages: These bases CANNOT be destroyed by anything less than a well-placed tactical nuclear warhead or a full-blown colony drop.
<br>- Disadvantages: There's only one really... Cost! These fortresses are expensive.
<br>- Cost: 750 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/comborogue.gif">
<br><b>Combo</b>
<br>Multiple base locations can be purchased at one time for a compound, although some combinations (Airborne+Underground?) are impossible. Don't be a jackass.<a name="addons">
<br>
<br>
<br><center><font size=4><b>Add-ons</b></font></center>
While compounds come with their own integral hangars, HQ bunkers and what have you, additional and more sophisticated buildings can be purchased at additional price. These add-ons can be targetted and destroyed by enemy attack, and while integral features of a base can be repaired, add-on features must be repurchased.
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/minefield.png">
<br><b>Minefield</b>
<br>A simple field of explosive proximity mines, this can be used to delay an enemies advance into a fortress. There are three types of minefield, land mines, underwater mines and space mines, and each must be purchased seperately. Minefields can be purchased while your compound is under siege, albeit at double price.
<br>-
<br>- Note: May be underground, underwater or in space, terrain permitting
<br>- Cost: 150 RP (300 if sieged)
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/listeningpost.png">
<br><b>Listening Post (D)</b>
<br>A small outpost at the edge of a bases controlled area, designed as an early warning system against attack. Usually not armed, these posts seek to deter scouts and surprise attacks on the base proper.
<br>-
<br>- Effect: Acts as a detector unit. <b>(D)</b>
<br>- Cost: 200 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/perimeterwall.png">
<br><b>Perimiter Wall</b>
<br>An outer wall designed to repel a first wave of attack, this add-on enlarges the effective area of a compound, allowing for more defensive emplacements. If purchased for a Space Colony or Asteroid, this in effect redesigns the colonies hull for military use.
<br>-
<br>- Effect: +10 maximum defenses.
<br>- Cost: 200 RP
<br>
<br>

<br><b>Trenches</b>
<br>Simple and affordable, mobile suit sized Trenches can be constructed to give your MS defenses just a little bit more surviveability. Unlike most things, Trenches can be purchased while your compound is under seige, albeit at double price.
<br>-
<br>- Note: May be underground, terrain permitting
<br>- Cost: 200 RP (400 if sieged)
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/barracks.png">
<br><b>Enlarged Barracks</b>
<br>Even though the glory of combat has gone to the mobile suit, infantry can still make a difference, ground forces being required to maintain control of an area or capture an enemy ship. Large bases will increase the size of their barracks, incorporating more security personnel.
<br>-
<br>- Effect: Maximum hangar space +10 infantry.
<br>- Cost: 250 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/cellblock.png">
<br><b>Enlarged Cellblock</b>
<br>While all fortresses carry simple cellblocks, these can be enlarged to make it much more difficult for a captured pilot to escape. This add-on functions as a normal Cellblock where none exist naturally.
<br>-
<br>- Cost: 300 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/hospital.png">
<br><b>Hospital</b>
<br>All fortresses have clinics where front lines doctors patch the injured up as best they can, but few can boast actual military hospitals. These buildings will assist in tending to the wounded, keeping people fighting even during a long siege.
<br>-
<br>- Effect: Reduces all PCs injury times by 1 while on the compound.
<br>- Cost: 300 RP (200 on Urban)
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/targeting.png">
<br><b>Targeting Facility</b>
<br>A complex radar, sonar, infrared, and audio tracking station, these facilities stay in the fairly safe portions of a land Fortress for protection and to provide targeting data to friendly turrets, improving their accuracy.
<br>-
<br>- Cost: 400 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/hangar.png">
<br><b>Enlarged Hangar</b>
<br>Extremely important locations will enlarge and add secondary hangars, to increase the number of servicable units in their territory.

<br><img src="sprites/colonybooster.png">
<br><b>Colony Booster</b>
<br>To move your colony quicker or to initiate a colony drop, you need one of these boosters. Simply a large rocket that latches onto the backside of your colony, the Booster is an essential part of all colony movement and allows your colony to move at half the speed of a regular mobile suit, rather than one fourth.
<br>-
<br>- Cost: 1,000 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/spaceport.png">
<br><b>Spaceport</b>
<br>Necessary for construction on terrestrial fortresses, the Spaceport allows regular space warships and mobile suits to land, refuel, and be equipped with single-use boosters to get back into space again, allowing otherwise space-bound vessels and mobile suits to enter Earth. Spaceports may be purchased for a Lunar fortress, but are not necessary for a ship to escape the moons gravity well.

<br>- Income: +40 RP
<br>- Cost: 1,500 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/nuclearcharge.png">
<br><b>Nuclear Charge</b>

<br>The ultimate in "Base Insurance," this is actually an Inter-Continental-Ballistic-Missile with the rocket section removed and stripped down to the bare essentials. This charge sits in the middle of a Fortress in wait to be activated. After the entire base's defenses have been destroyed, this charge is activated and will detonate when a mobile suit, tank, or even infantry triumphantly march into the base.
<br>-
<br>- Cost: 2,000 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="sprites/warfactory.png">
<br><b>War Factory</b>
<br>The War Factory, once constructed, can harvest the resources needed and then produce any product in the shop. How many can be produced in a one-week production run is based on cost. A War Factory is somewhat different from a mine, as it produces weaponry even during a siege.
<br>-
<br>- Effect: The factory is credited 500 RP every Sunday, which can be used at any time to purchase shop materials at the factories location. Remaining RP is stockpiled until spent.
<br>- Cost: 2,500 RP<a name="defenses">
<br>
<br>
<br><center><font size=4><b>Defenses</b></font></center>

Clearly even the best base will fall eventually without its own defensive armament. Turrets and gun emplacements can be purchased up to a bases defensive emplacement maximum, to assist in defending the area. (R) marked defenses cannot make All Range Attack actions, but will shell enemy fleets during a siege.

The Antarctic Treaty is around, alive and kicking, but it never seems to be so big a deal to actually prevent the liberal use of nuclear warheads in the UC world, and this is reflected here. When purchased, WMDs will remain off a units roster page until they are actually used.

<br><b>Mass Driver</b>
<br>A gigantic railgun designed to ferry cargo between long distances of space at extreme speeds, it is very easy to modify a Mass Driver into an effective weapon. Designed to fire a heavy armor piercing shell with incredible accuracy and speed, a Mass Driver round does not cause the collateral damage of a nuclear missile, but is deadly all the same. The downside of this weapon is its size and sophistication makes it difficult to arm and aim properly.
<br>-
<br>- Rules: A Mass Driver is attached to a compound like an Add-On, and cannot be moved once purchased. Once built, the driver can target a single compound or fleet per update. This target can be anywhere in the same territory as the Mass Driver, meaning it can fire on an enemy fleet before it actually reaches the weapons location.
<br>- Note: Building this requires a build action. Only buildable in space.

<br><center><font size=4><b>Pilots</b></font></center>
Pilots of higher levels may be purchased for NPC units, both ships and mobile weapons, to enhance their effectiveness. While sometimes not very cost effective, in the right situations these pilots can be an excellent buy. The Newtype option can be purchased in addition to a standard option, but only if both are purchased together.

<br><center><font size=4><b>Services</b></font></center>
Services are temporary assistance to a PC engagement from NPC forces and patrols. Each Rogue in a battle may purchase one service to assist them. Services may not be purchased in enemy territory, and are 1/2 price in friendly territory.
<br>

<br>
<br><b>Guerilla contact</b>
<br>There are many guerillas and militia groups on eager to help an assault if the right incentive is provided.
<br>-
<br>- Effect: Support from 4x guerrilla units.
<br>- Note: Only purchasable in the Earth Sphere.
<br>- Cost: 50 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Mechanic contact</b>
<br>Although it is normally very difficult for a Rogue to repair their mobile weapon, they can often enlist the help of professional mechanics before a battle.
<br>-
<br>- Effect: Repair normally after battle, or repair ships at your position one damage grade. In order to use this service to repair ships the Rogue must have access to a Spare Parts cargo (it is not expended) and the ships repaired in this way cannot make any other action that day. This service can only effect units once per update.
<br>- Cost: 50 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Transport service</b>
<br>Unable to use Federation or Zeon controlled Spaceports, a Rogue must purchase CMC shuttle fare in order to move themselves on or off of Earth.
<br>-
<br>- Effect: Moves Rogue or Rogue owned ship to/from Earth Orbit.
<br>- Cost: 50 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Riah flight support</b>
<br>Members of the Riah Militia can call on Riah patrols to assist them in defending Side 6, much the same way Zeon and Federation members do in their own territory.
<br>-
<br>- Note: Only purchasable if on Side 6 and allied with Riah Republic.
<br>- Effect: Flight support from 6x Torieres fighter or 5x Dracken-E.
<br>- Cost: 50 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Merchant contact</b>
<br>There are many CMC merchants travelling to and fro in the Earth Sphere, and for a cost it is possible to obtain a merchant clearance, assisting in evading a blockade.
<br>-
<br>- Effect: Help evading a patrol or blockade.
<br>- Cost: 100 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Terrorist contact</b>
<br>Able to infiltrate enemy bases and ships, many Rogues will time their assaults to pre-set explosives, disabling enemy defenses during the attack.
<br>-
<br>- Effect: Bomb a compound or ship during an assault.
<br>- Cost: 100 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Dummy units</b>
<br>Space is a large, difficult to monitor place, and sophisticated mobile suit and ship sensors can be fooled by simple tricks. Using thruster-equipped balloons designed to look exactly like the real thing, a fleet can hide its real intentions by deploying a decoy fleet.
<br>-

<br>- Effect: Balloon ship and/or mobile suit purchases.
<br>- Note: Only purchasable in space.
<br>- Cost: 100RP +1/10th of real ship/mobile suit costs +X amount. X may be anything, and exists to disguise the real cost of the dummy fleet from OCD players.
<br>- Addendum: Dummy units are intended to be a way to bend the very linear movement rules in space and trick people. I am willing to accomodate wild nefarious schemes for this service.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Hacker contact</b>
<br>Expert spies, a Rogue is capable of obtaining enemy secrets much easier than his Federation or Zeon counterparts. Purchasing this service requires a Sell action.
<br>-
<br>- Effect: Rogue gains access to either the base Federation or Zeon password. Password will be reset the following Sunday.<a name="variants">
<br>- Cost: 1,000 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><center><font size=4><b>Variants</b></font></center>
There are two types of variant options, which can be purchased with a refit action. The first type, soft refits, are reversable and can be purchased anywhere. The second type, hard refits, are irreversable and can only be purchased at an installation. Variants are available both to player and NPC units. The one exception to this rule is Medea B Types, Gyan and Gelgoog variants count as soft refits for player MS and hard refits for NPC MS.
<br>
<br>Note: Unlike Ef and Zeon refits, Rogue ships and MS can be refitted multiple times. Each of the special Rogue refits can be put on any ship once. A ship may not have more than five different refits.

<br>
<br><img src="sprites/domfunf.GIF">
<br><b>Dom Funf/Dom Tropen</b>

<br><b>Gelgoog/Gelgoog Cannon (A)</b>
<br>Using the same frame and equipment as the original Gelgoog, but with a backpack designed to support a heavy anti-battleship beam cannon. The Gelgoog Cannon is exceptional for ambushes and support fire, the beam cannon packing as much punch as a Musai deck gun, but with a slow rate of fire.
<br>- Additional armament: 1x anti-battleship beam cannon
<br>- Additional equipment: Forearm hardpoints can also mount 3-tube missile launchers (1 round)
<br>- Cost: 70 RP, free for PC units
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Harsh Climate Equipment</b>
<br>Making due with what materials they have available, a Rogue can modify his mobile suit to operate in desert, tropical, or arctic conditions with increased effectiveness. The added weight and removal of redundant systems will reduce the mobile suits effectiveness outside of the specified environment.
<br>- Note: Only available to PC mobile suits.
<br>- Cost: 50 RP, will automatically be removed when you leave the harsh climate.

<br><b>Custom Headspike</b>
<br>Rogues like to modify their units to distinguish them from those used by the regular military. Similar to MS modifications given to military officers, a Rogue can attach additional sensor and comminications antennae to their mobile suit, identifying it as a commander unit. This modification is only available on units without headspikes or commanders antennae.
<br>- Note: Only available to PC mobile suits, gives additional sensor and communication range.
<br>- Cost: 105 RP

<br>- Cost: 105 RP
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Optional Armament Upgrade</b>
