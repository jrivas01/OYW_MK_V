<br>The maps are divided into three types of area: Territories, Locations, and Compounds. Locations exist inside Territories, and Compounds can exist inside Locations or Territories. You may only move between adjacent areas, and each move is one move action. For example, Side 5 is a Location inside the Territory 2 Days from Earth (2E), and Texas Colony is a Compound in Side 5. It is one move action to go from 2E to Side 5, and another to go from Side 5 to Texas Colony. The reverse is also true.
<br>
<br>Base pages can be found by clicking on the individual flags on the map. Installations are the larger flags, while Facilities are the smaller flags. Individual base pages alternate between present defenses and descriptions/map via links on the names.
<br>
<br>
<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b>Earth's Surface</b></font></center>
<br>The entire planet Earth exists inside the 0 days from Earth territory, with the sectors on the map above classed as Locations. Each Earth Location and all Compounds on Earth are adjacent to the Earth Orbit Location, which must be moved through when going between Earth's Surface and 0 Days from Earth. Note that the two Pacific Ocean sectors on the map are the same Location, and West Antarctic is adjacent to East Antarctic.
<br>
<br>The following additional rules and restrictions apply to movement on Earth.
<br>
<br><b>Earth Orbit</b>
<br>Players must be on a Compound equipped with a Spaceport to move from Earth to Earth Orbit, or moving to a Compound equipped with a Spaceport on the planet. Space class ships can move to and from Spaceport equipped compounds, but they may not move to any other Earth locations.
<br>
<br><b>(O)</b> class ships and mobile suits can move from Earth Orbit to any Location or Compound on Earth. They must use spaceports to return to Earth Orbit.
<br>
<br>Ships with M Craft systems can move to Earth Orbit from any Location or Compound on Earth freely.
<br>
<br><b>Earth's Oceans</b>
<br>Earth's Oceans restrict ship and fleet movement in the following ways:
<br>
<br>Naval class ships cannot move between Central Asia and East Asia or East Arctic.
<br>
<br>Land class ships not listed as Hovercraft cannot move to the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean or Pacific Ocean locations.
<br>
<br>Land class ships not listed as Hovercraft cannot move between Europe and West Arctic, South America and West Antarctic, South Africa and Central Antarctic, or Australia and East Antarctic.
<br>
<br><b>Weather</b>
<br>Locations on Earth are sometimes plagued with bad weather, which hinders combat of any variety. Weather for each location will be determined once a week, and noted on the passworded Side boards. Just because one location is experiencing bad conditions doesn't mean you will be caught in it, but it's better to be prepared than try your luck.
<br>
<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF">Area Descriptions</b></font></center>
<br>
<br><b>North Africa</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> Home to the largest deserts on Earth, North Africa is filled with a surprising amount of life despite its lack of water. Inhabited cities dot its many shores, and the Suez Canal takes travelers from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. Still home to many religious groups of the old world, Zeon maintains a loose hold on its many cities from their base in Alexandria, and several resource mines line its periphery.
<br>
<br><b>South Africa</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> Home to jungles, mountains, grasslands and the occasional diamond mine, South Africa is not the dry and barren landscape that depicts its northern cousin. Huge quantities of wildlife and human settlement in all ranges of technological advancement are what characterize South Africa, and the war has seen only a small amount of encroachment on these peoples. Zeon manages a fortress and a small mining colony here, with the island of Madagascar barely under Federation control.
<br>
<br><b>North America</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The site of two of Zeon's chief bases on Earth, North America was ravaged by war in the early part of 0079, but has since started to recover. North America contains a huge number of environments, from the mountainous Rockies in the west, to the cold plains of the north, to tropical jungles in the south. Its waters are clear and easily navigable, and the many Caribbean islands are still just as beautiful and wondrous as they were hundreds of years ago. North and South America are separated at the Panama Canal, which still traffics navies from the Pacific to the Caribbean.
<br>
<br><b>South America</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The surface of South America looks much as it has for centuries, that of a thick and wondrous jungle, with a few cities and habitated sectors along its many rivers. The Andes Mountains in the west form a small area of steppe and desert, but the majority of the continent is lush, tropical land. The Federation headquarters at Jaburo lies somewhere underground in this savage land, its city sized caverns holding the might of the Federal war machine.
<br>
<br><b>East Arctic</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> An expanse of land covering most of old Russia, the East Arctic is a cold and forested land, although not quite as mountainous as the West Arctic. Its sea routes are barely navigable, covered in ice and glaciers, but the land is somewhat more hospitable and habitated. Little combat has been seen here, although Zeon maintains an outpost in the region. A small gap of water dividing Alaska and Siberia is the only passable way for land battleships travelling from Eurasia to the Americas.
<br>
<br><b>West Arctic</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> Land going from the western tip of Alaska to the eastern shores of Greenland, this area is characterized by frigid cold, thick forests, and a minor amount of human settlement. The waters in the northern part of the sector are filled with icy glaciers, and mountains dot the landscape at various areas. A small gap of water dividing Alaska and Siberia is the only passable way for land battleships travelling from Eurasia to the Americas.
<br>
<br><b>The 3 Antarctic Sectors</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The Antarctic is home to almost nothing but ice and snow, gale force winds ravaging its shores without relief. The geography of Antarctica is extremely predictable, rolling ice deserts and cold wastelands as far as the eye can see. A few small irregularities exist, such as the Transantarctic Mountains that cut straight through the middle of the continent, or the almost habitable Antarctic Peninsula that juts out of the west, reaching towards South America. The East is home to the scientific research facility Bolse Station, where the infamous Antarctic Treaty was signed on January 31st, 0079. Antarctica's waters are cold and icy, icebergs floating about in this frozen region.
<br>
<br><b>Atlantic Ocean</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The most heavily trafficked ocean on Earth, the Atlantic is filled with trade between Africa, Europe and the Americas, control loosely maintained by a Federation base on the Azores. The climate of the Atlantic changes heavily, from icy at the northern and southern edges, to temperate and tropical in the center.
<br>
<br><b>Australia</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> Linked to East Asia by strings of islands, Australia is the land that was marred by the disastrous Operation British, a colony drop aimed at Jaburo that was knocked off course early in the war. Its land is mostly steppe, but contains a few solitary mountains and jungles, and its waters are home to a spectacular amount of wildlife. Both Zeon and Federation have bases in the region, but Australia is given the least amount of attention in regards to the war, only minor skirmishes pushing into its center now and again.
<br>
<br><b>Central Asia</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The center of the Duchy of Zeon's command structure in Eurasia, Central Asia is a landlocked area of cold mountainous steppe, separated from Europe by the Ural Mountains in the west and East Asia by the Himalayas in the south. The massive fortress of Odessa marks the easiest route into the region, the huge spaceport at Baikonour almost in the exact center of the area. The areas only coastal regions surround the Black and Caspian seas, the Black Sea only accessible by the Zeon controlled Sea of Marmara at Constantinople.
<br>
<br><b>Earth Orbit:</b> Just outside Earth's atmosphere. This region is relatively clean, due to the fact that most debris from destroyed war machines quickly burn up in the atmosphere. Beware of combat here; smaller craft,  chiefly fighters and mobile suits, run the risk of being caught by gravity and falling to their deaths.
<br>
<br><b>East Asia</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> A large sector filled with tropical jungles and thousands of islands big and small, East Asia is the second most fought over part of Earth. It is separated from Central Asia by the Himalayan mountain range, the deserts of old Pakistan marking the western border with North Africa. What lies in between is an endless number of rivers, rice paddies and jungles, with a few habitated cities here and there. The Earth Federations control in the region centers around India in the south, with Zeon holding the more mountainous regions of China and Tibet in the north.
<br>
<br><b>Europe</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The single most habitated part of Earth in the Universal Century, Europe is filled with cities of all shapes and sizes, in addition to forests, mountain ranges and the occasional rolling plain. The war has struck Europe harder than any other area, with Zeon holding the eastern end at Constantinople, the Federation maintaining control of the British Isles. The lands in between are home to constant battles, the two sides moving back and forth in a months long deadlock.
<br>
<br><b>Indian Ocean</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> A stormy and unpredictable ocean compared to the Pacific and Atlantic, the Indian Oceans monsoon storms mystified travelers for thousands of years, and remain just as strong in the Universal Century as they were in times past. The Federal fortress at Sri Lanka controls the region, supply routes moving between India and Australia, South America, and the islands of Southeastern Asia.
<br>
<br><b>Pacific Ocean</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> The largest of the worlds three ocean sectors, the Pacific Ocean is also the deepest, containing a tremendous amount of wildlife. The Federation controls the sector from its sprawling naval base on the Hawaiian islands, and the small islands of Oceania dot the western half of the sector. Supply fleets move to East Asia from South America, while Zeon submarines sneak past Federal patrols deep under the waves.
