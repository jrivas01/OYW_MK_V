<br>The maps are divided into three types of area: Territories, Locations, and Compounds. Locations exist inside Territories, and Compounds can exist inside Locations or Territories. You may only move between adjacent areas, and each move is one move action. For example, Side 5 is a Location inside the Territory 2 Days from Earth (2E), and Texas Colony is a Compound in Side 5. It is one move action to go from 2E to Side 5, and another to go from Side 5 to Texas Colony. The reverse is also true.
<br>
<br>Base pages can be found by clicking on the individual flags on the map. Installations are the larger flags, while Facilities are the smaller flags. Individual base pages alternate between present defenses and descriptions/map via links on the names.

<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b>Mars Sphere</b></font></center>
<br>The map of the Mars Sphere is broken into four territories, dubbed "Days from Mars" and ranging from 0 to 3. For example, 2 days from Mars is adjacent to 1 day from Mars, 3 days from Mars, and any Locations inside 2 days from Mars. The Mars Orbit Location at 0 Days from Mars is used when moving on or off of Mars.
<br>
<br>The following are the list of Locations in the Mars Sphere Territories, and any additional rules and restrictions that apply to movement in the Mars Sphere.
<br>
<br><b>Locations List</b>
<br>0 days from Mars<font color="#3300FF"><b>:</b></font> Mars Orbit
<br>1 day from Mars<font color="#3300FF"><b>:</b></font> Phobos
<br>2 days from Mars<font color="#3300FF"><b>:</b></font> Deimos
<br>3 days from Mars<font color="#3300FF"><b>:</b></font> -
<br>
<br><b>Mars Orbit</b>
<br>Players must be on a Compound equipped with a Spaceport to move from Mars to Mars Orbit, or moving to a Compound equipped with a Spaceport on the planet. Space class ships can move to and from Spaceport equipped compounds, but they may not move to any other Mars locations.
<br>
<br><b>(O)</b> class ships and mobile suits can move from Mars Orbit to any Location or Compound on Mars. They must use spaceports to return to Mars Orbit.
<br>
<br>Ships with M Craft systems can move to Mars Orbit from any Location or Compound on Mars freely.
<br>
<br><b>Purchases</b>
<br>You may not make any purchases other than Compounds, their accessories, and Variants in the Mars Sphere. Rogue members may additionally purchase Services, Cargo, and Infantry.
<br>
<br><b>Deep Space</b>
<br>It is possible to travel to the Earth Sphere, Jupiter Sphere or Asteroid Belt from 5 Days from Mars. This is not something you're expected to do regularly, and rules for this are listed on the <a href="http://oywrpg4.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=5main&action=display&thread=1587&page=1#16663" target=new><u>message board.</u></a>
<br>
<br><center><font size=5 color="#3300FF"><b>Area Descriptions</b></font></center>
<br>
<br><b>0-3 Days from Mars</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> Although the Mars Sphere is not uninhabited, it is more or less devoid of people, and this characterizes the void surrounding the planet just as much as its red surface. Seeing any sort of other spacecraft in Mars space is a rarity, and the only manned waystations exist on its two moons. Space travel in Mars is almost always a silent and undisturbed adventure.
<br>
<br><b>Deimos</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> Even smaller than Phobos, Deimos barely has its own gravitational pull, although it is more than possible to break orbital velocity on a bicycle. Still, Deimos is somewhat larger than your average asteroid fortress. Deimos has no inhabitants other than a single CMC waystation numbering less than a thousand people.
<br>
<br><b>Mars Orbit</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> Just outside Mars atmosphere, this area is similar to Earths atmosphere, although due to a weaker gravitational pull is not quite so dangerous. Beware of combat here; smaller craft, chiefly fighters and mobile suits, run the risk of being caught by gravity and falling to their doom. 
<br>
<br><b>Phobos</b> <font size=4 color="#3300FF"><b>-</b></font> Although one of the smallest moons in the solar system, Phobos is still considerably larger than your average asteroid base. Extremely close to Mars itself relative to your average moon, it is extremely large when seen from the surface, despite its small size. A single small trade settlement and weather station, with some 100,000 citizens, is maintained on the surface of Phobos.
