"Battles", "Events", "Roster", "Member Art", "Major Events", "Chatroom", "Message Boards", "Sides", "Battle Types", "Bases and Ships", "Von Braun", "Veteran Points" and "Days" are copyright Dyrik of All Gundam.<br>
The color Black, "Timeline", "Map" (as an evolution of Dyrik Shinagamis copyrighted Bases and Ships) and whitedot.jpg are copyright After Era Incorporated. "How much VP a mobile doll has" is still up for legal dispute. Additionally, the phrases "Happy Dance", "Punch and Pie", "Dieing" and "Cool Beans" are copyright After Era Incorporated as well as "The Book of Gabe" and "Rules of Rueing", though usage of "Happy Dance" has been deferred to Ketara Elschitan (though not Eldoreth of Nimrodel) and An'Ya Dokuga. Because of the efforts of a few disreputable individuals, it is illegal for pandas to perform the "Happy Dance." Those who understand that reference should be given a single cookie, but not a Gummy Bear Cookie.<br>
Gummy Bear Cookies are copyright Dan / Lain.<br>
Sarcasm and Humor are copyright 800,000 BCE Wolfram and Hart, attornies at law, though exact legal ownership is filed under their chief partner, Thomas Sauntier. Gundam Night Live is also copyright Thomas Sauntier. Silliness is copyright 2003 "Yatta".<br>

"Profile Board" is copyright Vash the Stampede LastNameForgottenandTrivial, as well as After Era Incorporated.<br>
"Sparring" as well as "Saxattack" and "Tomorrow morning" are copyright Berrik, but not Troika because that name is dumb.<br>
"Big News" is copyright Eoin Pneumothorax Awesome Steve, as are Ostriches.<br>
Overly large "Shops", "Scope", "Fleets", "Tactical Map", "MS Profiles", and phrases "Update Blather" and "Muppetfuckers" are copyright Vladimir Antonov of the One Year War RPG.
